  INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
  
             This case exemplifies much of what is wrong, and much of what is right, with
  
  IDEA.                 is a                             student with              (T: 430-431).      She has a
  
  number of                                , but presents with
  
                               , including
  
                               .   Over a period of many years, the parents and the Department of
  
  Education       (“DOE”),         while largely in agreement as to the                child’s   strengths and
  
  weaknesses, have had an ongoing disagreement as to how her needs should appropriately
  
  be met. Throughout that time-period, the parents have consistently sought to have                             ’s
  needs met in a less restrictive environment than has been recommended by the DOE.
  
             The matter before me began in the 2012-2013 school year, although this dispute
  
  had been ongoing since at least the 2008-2009 school year. Three different due process
  
  complaints (PE-A; PE-RR and PE-SS) have advanced issues that appear to be similar in
  
  their theme     – how to support              in an educational environment that is far less restrictive
  
  than recommended by the             DOE’s CSE.       The school years at issue include the 2012-2013,
  
  2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years. An almost unimaginable amount of
  
  energy has been expended by the parents and their capable counsel in advocating for a
  
  highly supported placement in a setting far less restrictive than recommended by the
                    1
  DOE’s      CSE.        At least three different hearing officers have been assigned to decide this
  
  matter, with at least two of them recusing themselves for various reasons after becoming
  
  actively engaged in the case, and many others recusing themselves after less involvement.
  
  Throughout that time period,                      has, by virtue of various pendency orders, been
  
  educated in an environment that is far closer to that desired by the parents than had been
  
  recommended by the DOE. She has reportedly made gains, although perhaps not as many
  
  gains as may have been desired by her parents.

      There have been numerous references during the course of the instant hearing to a pending class action
  lawsuit involving            While I have no doubt as to the potential importance of this litigation in resolving
  issues that clearly need resolution in connection with the provision of appropriate special education
  programs and services to the educationally disabled students residing in New York City, I have not
  considered this pending litigation for any purpose in deciding the much more limited matters before me.

    Case No. 145198
  
  
  
            The issues identified in the three due process complaints are hereby decided as set
  
  forth herein.
  
  THE HEARING EVIDENCE
  
            The hearing in this matter took place over 6 days, with many additional phone
  
  conferences being held in between.       Hundreds of pages of exhibits were offered and
  
  admitted into evidence.      It is undisputed that the recommendations made by the CSE
  
  during the time-period covered by the three due process complaints failed to offer         a
  
  FAPE during that time period. The DOE acknowledged as much. Yet, notwithstanding
  
  this rather clear admission, the issue of what to do about it is not nearly as clear.     As
  
  indicated above, the DOE has provided           with a significant amount of support during
  
  the time-period covered by the issues before me.       This support was the result of hard-
  
  fought legal battles waged by and on behalf of the parents and student and cannot be
  
  ignored in fashioning a remedy for the acknowledged denial of FAPE during the years at
  
  issue. I find that the hearing issues before me are really quite narrow. Specifically, can
  
  this   child’s needs be appropriately met in an educational   environment like that which has
  
  and is sought by the parents? If so, what, if any, additional steps can be taken, whether in
  
  the form of compensatory education services or otherwise, to further the goal of
  
  receiving appropriate educational services in that least restrictive environment?        My
  
  decision, and the remedy set forth herein, is focused upon these questions.
  
  THE LEGAL STANDARDS
  
            Pursuant to the IDEA, all children with disabilities are entitled to a “free
  appropriate public education” (“FAPE”) which must include “special education and
  related services” tailored to meet the unique needs of the child and be “reasonably
  calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.”   B oard of Education of the
  
  Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 207 (1982); (20
  
  U.S.C. § 1400[d][1][A]; Schaffer v. W east, 126 S. Ct. 528, 531 [2005]; Frank G. v. B oard
  
  of Education, 459 F.3d 356, 371 [2nd Cir. 2006]). A FAPE is offered to a student when
  
  (a) the board of education complies with the procedural requirements set forth in the
  
  IDEA, and (b) the IEP developed by its CSE through the IDEA’s procedures is reasonably

   Case No. 145198
  
  
  
  calculated to enable the student to receive educational benefits (Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-
  
  07; Cerra v. Paw ling Central School District, 427 F.3d 186, 192 [2nd Cir. 2005]). The
  
  Second Circuit Court of Appeals in W alczak v. Florida Union Free School District, 142
  
  F.3d 119 (2nd Cir. 1998) held that the IDEA does not articulate any specific level of
  
  educational benefits that must be provided through an IEP.        The Court citing to the
  
  Supreme Court ruling in Rowley reiterated that the IDEA does not require the states to
  
  maximize the potential of disabled children, but was meant “more to open the door of
  public education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to guarantee any
  
  particular level of education once inside” (at pg. 192). The Second Circuit in    W alczak
  
  also cites to a D.C. Circuit Court decision by now Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
  
  Ginsburg which held that because “public resources are not infinite,” federal law “does
  not secure the best education money can buy; it calls upon government, more modestly, to
  
  provide an appropriate education for each [disabled] child” (Lunceford       v. District of
  
  Columbia Bd. of Educ., 745 F.2d 1577, 1583 [D.C. Cir. 1984]). The Third Circuit has
  
  held that an appropriate education under the IDEA is one that is “likely to produce
  progress, not regression” (Cy press-Fairbank s   Indep. Sch. Dist. V . Michael F., 118 F.3d
  
  245, 248 [3rd Cir. 1997]; cert denied 522 U.S. 1047 [1998]; Cerra, 427 F.3d at 195,
  
  quoting W alczak, 142 F.3d at 130 [citations omitted]; see Perricelli v. Carm el Central
  
  School District,   2007 WL 465211, at *15).         The statute ensures an “appropriate”
  education, “not one that provides everything that might be thought     desirable by loving
  
  parents” (W alczak,   142 F.3d at 132, quoting Tucker v. Bay Shore Union Free School
  
  District, 873 F.2d 563, 567 [2nd Cir. 1989][citations omitted]; see Grim , 346 F.3d at
  
  379). The IEP must be “reasonably calculated to provide some ‘meaningful’ benefit”
  (Mrs. B. v. Milford B oard of Education, 103 F.3d 1114, 1120 [2nd Cir. 1997]; see
  
  Rowley, 458 U.S. at 192). Objective factors such as the attainment of passing grades and
  
  regular advancement from grade to grade are generally accepted indicators of satisfactory
  
  progress and one important factor in determining educational benefit (Rowley, 458 U.S. at
  
  207, n.28, 203-04; W alczak, 142 F.3d at 130; V iola v. A rlington Central School District,
  
  414 F. Supp. 2d 366, 382 [S.D.N.Y. 2006]).

   Case No. 145198
  
  
  
         The student’s recommended program           must also be provided in the least restrictive
  
  environment (LRE) (20 U.S.C. § 1412[a][5][A]; 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.114[a][2][i],
  
  300.116[a][2]; 8 NYCRR 200.6[a][1]; see W alczak, 142 F.3d at 132).                 The LRE is
  
  defined as “one that, to the greatest        extent possible, satisfactorily educates disabled
  
  children together with children who are not disabled, in the same school the disabled
  
  child would attend if the child were not disabled” (Carlisle      A rea Sch. V . Scott P., 62 F.3d
  
  520, 535 [3rd Cir. 1995]).       The IDEA mandates that all students with disabilities may
  
  only be removed to a more restrictive environment when the nature and severity of the
  
  disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and
  
  services    cannot     be   achieved   satisfactorily   (20   U.S.C.   1412[a][5][A];   34   CFR
  
  300.550[a][2]; Oberti v. Bd. of Educ., 995 F.2d 1204, 1213 [3rd Cir. 1993]; Briggs v. Bd.
  
  of Educ., 882 F.2d 688, 691 [2nd Cir. 1989]; Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ., 874 F.2d
  
  1036, 1044 [5th Cir. 1989]).
  
         “The fact that a student with a disability might make greater academic progress in
         a special education class may not warrant excluding the student from a regular
         education program (Oberti v. Borough of Clementon Sch. Dist., 995 F.2d 1204
              rd
         [3        Cir. 1993]). The CSE must also consider the unique benefits, academic and
         otherwise, which a student may receive by remaining in regular classes such as
         language and role modeling with nondisabled peers” (Greer              v. Rome City Sch.
         Dist., 950 F.2d 688 [11th Cir. 1991]).
  
  
         The Second Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the Oberti LRE test in P. v.
  
  Newington B oard of Educ., 546 F.3d 111 (2 nd Cir. 2008) requiring the consideration of
  
  whether the school has made reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in a regular
  
  classroom, the educational benefits to the child with appropriate supplementary aids and
  
  services versus a special class and the possible negative effects of the inclusion of the
  
  child on the education of the other students in the class.
  
         Federal district     courts have upheld the appropriateness of an IEP “given what the
  CSE knew about [the child] at the time it was developing the … IEP”             E.S . v. K atonah-
  
  Lewisboro School District, 742 F.Supp.2d 417 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).               In J.R . v. B oard of
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                         7
  
  
   Case No. 145198
  
  
  
  Education of the City of Rye School D istrict, 345 F.Supp.2d 386 (S.D.N.Y. 2004), the
  
  Court held that in reviewing the appropriateness of an IEP that:
  
                 “This determination is necessarily prospective in nature; we therefore must
         not engage in Monday-morning    quarterbacking guided by our knowledge of S.R.’s
         subsequent progress at Eagle Hill, but rather consider the propriety of the IEP with
         respect to the likelihood that it would benefit S.R. at the time it was devised. See
         A ntonaccio,   281 F.Supp.2d at 724 (noting that this issue has not yet been
         addressed by the Second Circuit and holding that ‘the …IEP…must be evaluated
         at the time the CSE devised the IEP, on June 15, 1999, and the IHO and SRO
         erred by regarding any information about [the student’s] education        after that
         date’).”
  
  The SRO has consistently considered the IEP “at the time it was formulated” to determine
  if it was reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive educational benefit
  
  (A pplication of a Student with a Disability, SRO Appeal Nos. 11-154, 09-034, 09-013).
  
         In terms of the available remedies in cases where a district has failed to meet its
  
  obligation to offer an educationally disabled child FAPE, IHO’s have substantial
  discretion. Since P. ex rel. M r. and Mrs. P. v. Newington Bd. of Educ., 546 F.3d 111, 122
  
  (2d Cir.2008), the courts of the Second Circuit have ceased to limit eligibility for
  
  “compensatory education” to those over 21. In P, the Second Circuit ruled that
  “compensatory education” can be awarded to an elementary school student. Further, even
  the “gross violation” requirement, which is applicable to a claim for compensatory
  education by someone over 21 is not clearly established in this Circuit to be applicable to
  
  a student under 21. That standard was not relied upon in P.
  
         In S.A . ex rel. M .A .K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 12-CV-435 (RMM)
  
  (MDG), 2014 WL 1311761 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2014), the Court held:
  
             The IDEA allows a hearing officer to fashion an “appropriate remedy, and ...
             compensatory education is an available option ... to make up for denial of a
             [FAPE].” P. ex   rel. Mr. and Mrs. P. v. Newington Bd. of Educ., 546 F.3d 111,
             122 (2d Cir.2008) (affirming compensatory education award for elementary
             school student); see also Student X v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., No. 07
             CV 2316, 2008 WL 4890440, at *24 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2008) (awarding
             compensatory education to student younger than twenty-one). Such an award
             serves “to compensate a student who was actually educated under an
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                              8

             inadequate IEP” and “to catch-up the student to where he should have been
             absent the denial of a FAPE.” B rennan v. Regional Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of
             Educ.,    531    F.Supp.2d       245,   265    (D.Conn.2008).    Before     awarding
             compensatory education for a student older than twenty-one, a court must find
             a gross violation of the student's right to a FAPE; however, whether the same
             prerequisite exists to awarding compensatory education for a younger student
             is an open question. See Student X, 2008 WL 4980440, at *24. P. v.
             Newington, 512 F.Supp.2d 89, 112 n. 3 (D. Conn.2007)          (“The Court disagrees
             with the defendant's argument that compensatory education is warranted only
             if there is a ‘gross' violation of the IDEA. The requirement of a gross violation
             ... has been applied only to cases involving claimants over the a ge    of 21.”),
             aff'd, 546 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2008); but see J.A . v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist.,
             603 F.Supp.2d 684, 690 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (finding that five-year-old student
             was not entitled to compensatory speech therapy, reasoning that parents failed
             to show gross  violation because child “was not excluded from school for any
             period of time.”).
  
         Also, Reid ex rel. Reid v. D.C., 401 F.3d 516, 522-26 (D.C. Cir. 2005) seems to
  
  stand for the proposition that “compensatory education” can be prospective educational
  services to compensate for a past deficient program and that a hearing officer, as well as a
  
  court, can fashion flexible “compensatory education” relief through the application of
  “equitable considerations.” Reid is cited by, for example, the Second        Circuit in P., 546
  
  F.3d at 123, for the proposition that “[t]he IDEA allows a hearing officer to fashion an
  appropriate remedy, and we have held compensatory education is an available option
  
  under the Act to make up for denial of a free and appropriate public     education.”
         It is well-settled that   the dispute between the parties must at all stages be “real and
  live” and not “academic” or it risks becoming moot (see Lillbask v. State ofConn. Dep’t
  of Educ., 397 F.3d 77, 84 [2d Cir. 2005]; Patsk in v. Bd. of Educ., 583 F. Supp. 2d 422,

  with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal
  
  No. 07-085; A pplication of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 07-077). In general,
  
  cases dealing with issues such as desired changes in IEPs, specific placements, and
  
  implementation disputes may become moot at the end of the school year because no
  
  meaningful relief can be granted (see, e.g., A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No.
  
  06-044; A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No. 05-058; A pplication of a Child with
  
  a Disability , Appeal No. 04-027; A pplication of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 00-
  
  037; A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No. 00-016; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Disability, Appeal No. 96-37). Administrative decisions rendered in cases concerning
  
  such issues arising out of school years that have since expired may no longer
  
  appropriately address the current needs of the student (see Daniel R.R. v. El Paso Indep.
  
  Sch. Dist., 874 F.2d 1036, 1040 [5th Cir. 1989]; M.S. v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ.,
  
  2010 WL 3377667, at *9 [E.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2010]; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Disability , Appeal No. 07-139; A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No. 07-028;
  
  A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 06-070; A pplication of a Child with
  
  a Disability , Appeal No. 04-007).
  
         An exception to the above rule relating the mootness of claims such as this
  
  provides that a claim may not be moot in such circumstances if the conduct complained
  
  of is 'capable of repetition, yet evading review' (see Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318-23
  
  [1988]; Lillbask, 397 F.3d at 84-85; Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1040; A pplication of a Child
  
  with a Disability , Appeal No. 04-038). The exception applies only in limited situations
  
  (City of Los A ngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 [1983]), and is severely circumscribed
  
  (K naust v. City of Kingston, 157 F.3d 86, 88 [2d Cir. 1998]). First, it must be apparent
  
  that 'the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its
  
  cessation or expiration' (Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 482 [1982]; see K naust, 157
  
  F.3d at 88; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139). Second,
  
  controversies are 'capable of repetition' when there is a reasonable expectation that the
  
  same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again (W einstein v.
  
  B radford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 [1975]; see Hearst Corp., 50 N.Y.2d at 714-15; A pplication

      Case No. 145198
  
  
  
  of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139). To create a reasonable expectation of
  
  recurrence, repetition must be more than theoretically possible (Murphy, 455 U.S. at 482;
  
  Russman v. Bd. of Educ., 260 F.3d 114, 120 [2d Cir. 2001]; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Disability , Appeal No. 07-139). Mere speculation that the parties will be involved in a
  
  dispute over the same issue does not rise to the level of a reasonable expectation or
  
  demonstrated probability of recurrence (Russman, 260 F.3d at 120; M.S., 2010 WL
  
  3377667, at *9 [noting that each year a new determination is made based on a student's
  
  continuing development]; J.N. v. Depew Union Free School Dist., 2008 WL 4501940, at
  
  *4 [W.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2008]; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-
  
  139). Mootness may be raised at any stage of litigation (In re Kurtzman, 194 F.3d 54, 58
  
  [2d Cir. 1999]; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139).
  
  FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
              I need not decide whether       ’s needs   can be appropriately met in an         .
  
  The facts of this matter suggest that, with a great deal of effort, she has made progress in
  
  that setting.       However, I find that the specific issues raised in the various due process
  
  complaints have, due to the passage of time, largely been rendered moot. I do not find
  
  that any of the exceptions are applicable. I find that no productive purpose would be
  
  served by individually deciding the specific issues that have been advanced in the three
  
  due process complaints.           Further, I find that no meaningful, specific relief can be
  
  fashioned at this time for alleged shortcomings in the manner in which the DOE offered
  
  FAPE during the past 5 years. I find, however, that, as a general proposition, the      DOE’s
  acknowledged denial of FAPE during this period warrants compensatory services as set
  
  forth herein. I find that the claim set forth in the    DOE’s Closing Brief that there has been
  no denial of FAPE is technically incorrect, although practically plausible. I further find
  
  that the nature and extent of the compensatory services that are appropriate must take into
  
  account the extensive services that the DOE had provided in accordance with the 1st and
      nd
  2        pendency orders. The compensatory services set forth herein are designed to support
  
  this     child’s   educational program going forward in a manner that will hopefully serve to
  
  end, or at least slow, the cycle of litigation that had clearly distracted the parties from

  They are expressly NOT intended to be supplemental to the services provided as part of
  
  the previously-issued pendency orders.

      Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  I. JURISDICTION - OVERVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
  
  
  
           This impartial due process proceeding arises under the Individuals with
  
  Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482, and Article 89 of the New
  
  York State Education Law. This hearing was requested by the advocates for the student
  
  and the parent in a due process complaint notice dated March 25, 2015.                       The primary
  
  issue to be determined at this hearing is whether the Department of Education (the
  
  “DOE”) shall be ordered to reimburse the parent, and/or directly pay for, costs associated
  
  with the student’s unilateral private placement at
  
            for the 2013/14 school year (Ex. P-A).1
  
           When a student in New York is eligible for special education services, the IDEA
  
  calls for the creation of an individualized education program (“IEP”), which is delegated
  
  to a local committee on special education (the “CSE”) that includes, but is not limited to,
  
  parents, teachers, at least one psychologist, and school district representatives. See N.Y.
  
  Educ. Law § 4402; see also 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414(d)(1)(a)-(b); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.320,
  
  300.321; 8 NYCRR §§ 200.3, 200.4(d)(2). If disputes occur between parents and school
  
  districts, incorporated among the procedural protections is the opportunity to engage in
  
  mediation, present state complaints, and initiate an impartial due process hearing. See 20
  
  U.S.C. §§ 1221e-3, 1415(e)-(f); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.151 - 300.152, 300.506, 300.511; N.Y.
  
  Educ. Law § 4404(1); 8 NYCRR §§ 200.5(h)-(l).
  
           New York State has implemented a two-tiered system of administrative review to
  
  address disputed matters between parents and school districts regarding “any matter
  
  relating to the identification, evaluation or educational placement of a student with a
  
  disability, or a student suspected of having a disability, or the provision of a free
  
  appropriate public education to such student.” See 8 NYCRR § 200.5(i)(1); see also 20
  
  U.S.C. §§ 1415(b)(6)-(7); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.503(a)(1)-(2), 300.507(a)(1). An impartial
  
  hearing officer (“IHO”) typically conducts a trial-type hearing regarding the matters in
  
  dispute in which the parties have the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and

  certain other individuals with special knowledge or training; present evidence and
  
  confront, cross-examine and compel the attendance of witnesses; prohibit the
  
  introduction of any evidence at the hearing that has not been disclosed five (5) business
  
  days before the hearing; and obtain a verbatim record of the proceeding. See 20 U.S.C.
  
  §§ 1415(f)(2)(a), (h)(1)-(3); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.521(a)(1)-(4); 8 NYCRR §§ 200.5(j)(3)(v),
  
  (vii), (xii). The IHO must render and transmit a final written decision in the matter to the
  
  parties not later than forty-five (45) days after the expiration period or adjusted period for
  
  the resolution process.       See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.510(b)(2), (c), 300.515(a); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.5(j)(5). A party may seek a specific extension of time of the 45-day timeline, which
  
  the IHO may grant in accordance with state and federal regulations.                    See 34 C.F.R. §
  
  300.515(c); 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(5).              The decision of the IHO is binding upon both
  
  parties unless appealed.        See N.Y. Educ. Law § 4404(1).              A party aggrieved by the
  
  decision of an IHO may appeal that decision to a State Review Officer (“SRO”).                         See
  
  N.Y. Educ. Law § 4402(2); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1415(g)(1); 34 C.F.R. § 300.514(b)(1); 8
  
  NYCRR § 200.5(k).
  
  II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
  
  
  
           The DOE appointed me to hear this matter on March 25, 2015. See 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.5(j)(3)(i).    Hearings in this matter was thereafter held on: December 2, 2015;
  
  February 8, 2016; and June 1, 2016.2 Appended to this decision are: a statement of appeal
  
  rights; a list of the persons in attendance at the hearings; and a list of the documents
  
  received into evidence. See 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(5)(v).
  
  III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
  
  
  
           At the time of the March 25, 2015 due process complaint, the student was

   Following my appointment to this case, the parties moved to extend the case compliance date in this matter
  several times in order to accommodate the availability of the parties’ witnesses and in order to allow for
  adequate time for my review of the hearing record taken on the extensive issues raised in the parent’s due
  process complaint. In considering those requests, I weighed the cumulative impact of the relevant factors
  and found that the stated reasons for the extensions justified the delay in the resolution of the matter and
  were in accordance with the requirements of due process. Accordingly, requests for extensions of the case
  compliance date were granted (R. 5-9, 46-47, 105-106; Exs.         IHO-I - IHO-XIX).      See 34 C.F.R. §
  300.515(c); 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(5).
      Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                                      5
  
      Case No. 155154
  
  
  
                     , has been diagnosed with
  
               , and presents with
  
                               (Exs. SD-1 at 2-3, SD-3, SD-5, P-A). For the 2013/14 school year,
  
  the student attended the                        at the
  
  (“                   ”) in               (Exs. P-A, P-E, P-F, P-G, P-G, P-J). The Commissioner
  
  of Education has not approved                              as a nonpublic school with which public
  
  school districts may contract to instruct students with disabilities.              See 8 NYCRR §§
  
  200.1(d), 200.7. The student's current eligibility for special education and related services
  
  as                                                            is not in dispute in this hearing (Exs.
  
  SD-1 at 1, P-A, P-C at 1). See 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(             ); 8 NYCRR § 200.1(zz)(         ).3
  
            The student attended                   at                     , where he was first evaluated
  
  and provided services through                              . The student then attended
  
              for about                 years.    Following that time, the student attended
  
             (Ex. SD-3).
  
            Testing administered on June 1, 2009 suggested
  
                , with                                                .                    , the student’s
  
  scores reflected
  
                               (Ex. SD-2 at 2).
  
            In January 2013, the student’s
  
                                   .   On the abbreviated form of the
  
                               , he obtained a                                                      . The
  
  student was also administered the                                                                .     The
  
  student                                were found to be within                       (
  
                                                           ) (Ex. SD-2 at 2-3).
  
            At a meeting held on April 10, 2013, the CSE recommended that student receive
  
  the majority of his instruction in a                            in a community school on a
  
            basis.   The CSE also recommended that the student receive related services of:

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  
                                      (Ex. SD-1 at 8-9, 12-13).
  
            On April 22, 2013, the parent signed an enrollment contract for the student’s
  
  attendance at                  for the 2013/14 school year (Ex. P-H).
  
            In a final notice of recommendation (“FNR”) dated May 30, 2013, the DOE
  
  advised the parent that the student’s recommended program would be implemented at
  
        in            .   In June 2013, the parent return the FNR to the DOE with a note
  
  stating that, after observing the proposed program, she did not believe it constituted an
  
  appropriate placement for him because                                   “
  
                                                                      ” (Ex. P-D).
  
            In a letter dated August 12, 2013, the parent advised the CSE that she was
  
  rejecting its proposed program for the student and would unilaterally place him at
  
            for the 2013/14 school year at public expense (Ex. P-E). This hearing ensued.
  
  IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
  
            A. The DOE
  
            The parent’s claim for tuition reimbursement and/or direct payment for the
  
  student’s unilateral placement at                   for the 2013/14 school year should be
  
  denied.    The DOE offered the student a free appropriate public education in the least
  
  restrictive environment for the 2013/14 school year.       The CSE which developed the
  
  student’s IEP was duly constituted. The CSE relied on sufficient and adequate evaluative
  
  information to develop its IEP for the student. The parent was permitted to meaningfully
  
  participate in the CSE meeting. The IEP goals and objectives were reasonably related to
  
  the student’s educational needs.    The proposed program was reasonably calculated to
  
  confer meaningful educational benefit to the student.                              was an
  
  inappropriate and overly restrictive placement for the student which failed to meet his
  
  special education needs.    The relevant equities also do not support the parent’s tuition
  
  reimbursement/direct payment claim.
  
            B. The Parent
  
            The DOE should be ordered to reimburse the parent, and/or directly pay, for the
       Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                                    7
  
       Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  student’s unilateral placement at                             for the 2013/14 school year. The DOE
  
  failed to develop an appropriate educational program for the student.                 The CSE which
  
  developed the student’s IEP was not duly constituted.                The CSE relied on insufficient
  
  evaluative information when it developed its IEP for the student.                 The parent was not
  
  permitted to meaningfully participate in the CSE meeting. The IEP goals and objectives
  
  were not reasonably related to the student’s educational needs. The                         and
  
           of the proposed program was not appropriate. The other students in the proposed
  
  program did not have similar                                                 needs.
  
  appropriately addressed the student’s unique educational needs.                 The relevant equities
  
  also support an award of tuition reimbursement, and/or direct public funding, of the
  
  student’s tuition to                        (Ex. P-A).
  
  V. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
             A. Applicable Legal Standards
  
             Two purposes of the IDEA, see 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482, are: (a) to ensure that
  
             students with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public
  
             education (“FAPE”) that emphasizes special education and related services
  
             designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,
  
             employment, and independent living; and (b) to ensure that the rights of students
  
             with disabilities and parents of such students are protected, see 20 U.S.C. §
  
             1400(d)(1)(A)-(B); see generally Forest Grove v. T.A ., 557 U.S. 230, 239 (2009);
  
             B oard of Educ. of the Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176,
  
             206-07 (1982).4
  
             A FAPE is offered to a student when: (a) the board of education complies with the
  
  procedural requirements set forth in the IDEA; and (b) the IEP developed by its CSE
  
  
  4
      The term “free appropriate public education” means special education and related services that –
              (A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without
  charge;
             (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency;
             (C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the
             State involved; and
             (D) are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section
             1414(d) of this title. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9); 34 C.F.R. § 300.17.

  through the IDEA's procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive
  
  educational benefits. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07; H.C. v. K atonah-Lew isboro Union

  10, 2013); M.H. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 685 F.3d 217, 245 (2d Cir. 2012);
  
  Cerra v. Paw ling Cent. Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 186, 192 (2d Cir. 2005).       "'[A]dequate
  
  compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of
  
  what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP.'" W alczak v. Florida
  
  Union Free Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at
  
  206); see T.P. v. M amaroneck Union Free Sch. Dist., 554 F.3d 247, 253 (2d Cir. 2009).
  
  While the Second Circuit has emphasized that school districts must comply with the
  
  checklist of procedures for developing a student's IEP and has indicated that "[m]ultiple
  
  procedural violations may cumulatively result in the denial of a FAPE even if the
  
  violations considered individually do not," see R.E., 694 F.3d at 190-91, the Court has
  
  also explained that not all procedural errors render an IEP legally inadequate under the
  
  IDEA, M.H., 685 F.3d at 245; A .C. v. Bd. of Educ., 553 F.3d 165, 172 (2d Cir. 2009);

  Carm el Cent. Sch. Dist., 2007 WL 465211, at *10
  
  (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2007).    Under the IDEA, if procedural violations are alleged, an
  
  administrative officer may find that a student did not receive a FAPE only if the
  
  procedural inadequacies: (a) impeded the student's right to a FAPE; (b) significantly
  
  impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding
  
  the provision of a FAPE to the student; or (c) caused a deprivation of educational
  
  benefits.   See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii); 34 C.F.R. § 300.513(a)(2); 8 NYCRR §

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
            The IDEA directs that, in general, an IHO's decision must be made on substantive
  
  grounds based on a determination of whether the student received a FAPE. See 20 U.S.C.
  
  § 1415(f)(3)(E)(i). A school district offers a FAPE "by providing personalized instruction
  
  with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that
  
  instruction." See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203. However, the "IDEA does not itself articulate
  
  any specific level of educational benefits that must be provided through an IEP."
  
  W alczak, 142 F.3d at 130; see Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189.           The statute ensures an
  
  "appropriate" education, "not one that provides everything that might be thought desirable
  
  by loving parents." See W alczak, 142 F.3d at 132 (quoting Tucker v. Bay Shore Union
  
  Free Sch. Dist., 873 F.2d 563, 567 (2d Cir. 1989); see also Grim, 346 F.3d at 379.
  
  Additionally, school districts are not required to "maximize" the potential of students with
  
  disabilities. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189, 199; Grim, 346 F.3d at 379; W alczak, 142 F.3d
  
  at 132.    Nonetheless, a school district must provide "an IEP that is 'likely to produce

  recommended program must also be provided in the least restrictive environment
  
  (“LRE”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.114(a)(2)(i), 300.116(a)(2); 8

                 1. CSE Composition
  
         The parent alleges that the April 10, 2013 CSE was not properly constituted (Ex. P-
  
  A at 2). An IEP must be prepared by a CSE having each of its required members. See,
  
  e.g., A pplication of a Child with a Disability (Byram Hills Cent. Sch. Dist.), Appeal No.
  
  99-54 (SRO July 31, 2000). A CSE must consist of: the parents of the student; at least

    Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  one regular education teacher of the student (if the child is, or may be, participating in the
  
  regular education environment); at least one special education teacher of the student, or if
  
  appropriate, at least one special education provider of the child; a school psychologist; a
  
  representative of the school district qualified to provide or supervise the provision of
  
  special education; and an individual who can interpret the evaluations being reviewed by
  
  the CSE. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414(b)(4)(A), (d)(1)(B); 34 C.F.R. § 300.321; N.Y. Educ.
  
  Law §§ 4402(1)(b), 4410(3), 8 NYCRR § 200.3(a).
  
         The evidence contained in the hearing record reflects the April 10, 2013 CSE
  
  meeting was duly constituted. In attendance at the April 10, 2013 CSE meeting was the
  
  student’s special education teacher from                     , a general education teacher
  
  (who also served as the district representative of the meeting), the parent, a school
  
  psychologist, a parent advocate, and a                        (R. 58, 68; Ex. SD-1 at 15).
  
         Alternatively, to the extent that the parent objected to Mr.                serving as
  
  the general education teacher at the April 10, 2013 meeting, I find that his participation in
  
  the meeting did not result in or contribute to a denial of FAPE. The IDEA requires that a
  
  CSE include not less than one regular education teacher of the student, if the student is or
  
  may be participating in the general education environment.               See 20 U.S.C. §
  
  1414(d)(1)(B)(ii); 34 C.F.R. § 300.321(a)(2); N.Y. Educ. Law § 4402(1)(b)(1)(a)(ii); 8
  
  NYCRR § 200.3(a)(1)(ii); E.A .M. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2012 W.L. 4571794,
  
  at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2012). The April 2013 CSE did not contain a regular education
  
  teacher who provided instruction to the student during the 2012/13 school year; however,
  
  it did include a regular education teacher, i.e., Mr.             (Ex. SD-1 at 15).     Even
  
  assuming, arguendo, that this was a procedural violation, it did not rise to the level of a
  
  denial of FAPE in this instance, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii); 34 C.F.R. §
  
  300.513(a)(2); 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(4)(ii), as the student was not recommended to
  
  participate in                                during the 2013/14 school year (Ex. SD-1 at
  
  8).
  
                         2. Adequacy of Evaluations
  
         The parent alleges that the CSE failed to administer the necessary evaluations to
  
  form the basis for the development of an appropriate IEP (Ex. P-A at 2).
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                         12
  
    Case No. 155154
  
  
  
             A school district must conduct an evaluation of a student where the educational or
  
  related services needs of a student warrant a reevaluation or if the student's parent or
  
  teacher requests a reevaluation, see 34 C.F.R. § 300.303(a)(2); 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(4);
  
  however, a district need not conduct a reevaluation more frequently than once per year
  
  unless the parent and the district otherwise agree and at least once every three years
  
  unless the district and the parent agree in writing that such a reevaluation is unnecessary,
  
  see 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.303(b)(1)-(2); 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(4).           A CSE may direct that
  
  additional evaluations or assessments be conducted in order to appropriately assess the
  
  student in all areas related to the suspected disabilities. See 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(3).
  
  Any evaluation of a student with a disability must use a variety of assessment tools and
  
  strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information about
  
  the student, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining,
  
  among other things the content of the student's IEP. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(2)(A); 34
  
  C.F.R. § 300.304(b)(1)(ii); Letter to Clark e, 48 IDELR 77 (OSEP 2007). In particular, a
  
  school district must rely on technically sound instruments that may assess the relative
  
  contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental
  
  factors.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(2)(C); 34 C.F.R. § 300.304(b)(3); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.4(b)(6)(x). A district must ensure that a student is appropriately assessed in all areas
  
  related to the suspected disability, including, where appropriate, social and emotional
  
  status.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(3)(B); 34 C.F.R. § 300.304(c)(4); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.4(b)(6)(vii).     An evaluation of a student must be sufficiently comprehensive to
  
  identify all of the student's special education and related services needs, whether or not
  
  commonly linked to the disability category in which the student has been classified. See
  
  34 C.F.R. § 300.304(c)(6); 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(6)(ix).
  
             I find that the CSE had adequate evaluative information of the student’s
  
             functional,developmental and academic needs upon which to premise its program
  
             for the student for the 2013/14 school year (R. 59; Ex. SD-1 at 1-3). At the April
  
             10, 2013 meeting, the CSE considered: a January 2013 progress report prepared
  
             by the student’s                      teacher; a January 12, 2013
  
             progress report; a January 15, 2013                     evaluation; a January 15,

           2013                           ; a February 22, 2013                             progress
  
           report; and an April 8, 2013                  progress report (R. 59; Exs. SD-1, SD-2,
  
           SD-3, SD-4, SD-5, SD-6, SD-7).          Ms.                      , the student’s
  
                       teacher at                   , was also present at the April 2013 CSE
  
           meeting, participated in the meeting’s discussion and gave input regarding the
  
           student’s                             (R. 58-59; Ex. SD-1 at 15).
  
                    3. Adequacy of IEP Goals
  
           The parent alleges that the              goals included in the student’s IEP failed to
  
  meet his unique educational needs (Ex. P-A at 2).              An IEP must include a written
  
  statement of measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals designed
  
  to meet the student’s needs that result from the student’s disability to enable the student to
  
  be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum, and meet each of
  
  the student’s other educational needs that result from the student’s disability.            See 20
  
  U.S.C.    §     1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II);   34   C.F.R.     §   300.320(a)(2)(i);    8   NYCRR     §§
  
  200.4(d)(2)(iii), 200.16(3)(3).     Each annual goal shall include the evaluative criteria,
  
  evaluation procedures and schedules to be used to measure progress toward meeting the
  
  annual goal during the period beginning with placement and ending with the next
  
  scheduled review by the committee.           See 8 NYCRR § 200.4(d)(2)(iii)(b); see also 20
  
  U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(III); 34 C.F.R. § 300.320(a)(3).
  
           I find that the CSE’s IEP for the student for the 2013/14 school year established
  
  annual educational goals which were reasonably related to his educational deficits. The
  
  April 10, 2013 IEP included annual goals in:
  
  
  
                                                                                         which were
  
  consistent with those educational deficits identified in the IEP and described what he
  
  could reasonably be expected to accomplish within a                             period. The annual
  
  goals also included the evaluative criteria, evaluation procedures and schedules to be used
  
  to measure the student’s progress toward meeting each annual goal (R. 62-63; Ex. SD-1 at
  
  4-7). See 8 NYCRR § 200.4(d)(2)(iii)(b); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(III); 34
  
  C.F.R. § 300.320(a)(3).

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
         C. Proposed Public Program - Substantive
  
         As noted earlier, the IDEA directs that, in general, an impartial hearing officer’s
  
  decision must be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the
  
  student received a FAPE. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E)(I). A school district offers a
  
  FAPE “by providing personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit
  
  the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.” See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203.
  
  The IEP must be “reasonably calculated to provide some ‘meaningful’ benefit.” M rs. B.
  
  v. Milford Bd. of Educ., 103 F.3d 1114, 1120 (2d Cir. 1997), quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at
  
  192.
  
         Based on the evidence submitted into the hearing record, I find that the CSE’s
  
  proposed program was reasonably calculated to provide the student with meaningful
  
  educational benefit.   According to the student’s                        teacher at
  
          , the student was                                                              in the
  
  spring of 2013 (R. 79; Exs. SD-1 at 1-2; SD-4). For the 2013/14 school year, the CSE
  
  recommended that student receive                                                            in
  
  a community school on a                      basis.   The CSE also recommended that the
  
  student receive related services of:
  
  
  
  
                                                                                               .
  
                                                                                          were
  
  also included in the student’s IEP (R. 60; Ex. SD-1 at 8-10, 12-13).            The CSE ’s
  
  recommended program mirrored his                              program at                     ,
  
  although there were only               enrolled students in the private program during the
  
  2012/13 school year (R. 66, 77; Ex. SD-1 at 2).
  
         Ms.         (formerly           ) testified at the hearing that the student’s primary
  
  educational need was support for                                                      (R. 80).
  
  To address those                        , the April 2013 CSE recommended the following
  
                          for the student:

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  
                        (R. 60-61; Ex. SD-1 at 3).      The CSE also included an annual
  
  educational goal in the student’s IEP to                                                 and
  
                                          (Ex. SD-1 at 7).
  
         D. Proposed Placement
  
         The parent asserts that the IEP could not have been appropriately implemented in
  
  the recommended placement, that
  
                                                                     , and that the
  
                    was not appropriate for him (Ex. P-A at 2).
  
         Generally, the sufficiency of the program offered by a school district must be
  
  determined on the basis of the IEP itself. See R.E., 694 F.3d at 186-88. The Second
  
  Circuit has explained that "[s]peculation that the school district will not adequately adhere
  
  to the IEP is not an appropriate basis for unilateral placement." R.E., 694 F.3d at 195; see
  
  E.H. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2015 WL 2146092, at *3 (2d Cir. May 8, 2015);
  
  R.B. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 603 Fed. App'x 36, 40 (2d Cir. Mar. 19, 2015); R.B.
  
  v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 589 Fed. App'x 572, 576 (2d Cir. Oct. 29, 2014); T.Y .,
  
  584 F.3d at 419. The Second Circuit has explained that, when parents have rejected an
  
  offered program and unilaterally placed their child prior to implementation of the
  
  student's IEP, "[p]arents are entitled to rely on the IEP for a description of the services
  
  that will be provided to their child," see P.K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 526 Fed.
  
  App'x 135, 141 (2d Cir. May 21, 2013), and that "'[t]he appropriate inquiry is into the
  
  nature of the program actually offered in the written plan,' not a retrospective assessment
  
  of how that plan would have been executed," K.L. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 530
  
  Fed. App'x 81, 87 (2d Cir. July 24, 2013), quoting R.E., 694 F.3d at 187. Accordingly,
  
  when a parent brings a claim challenging the district's "choice of school, rather than the
  
  IEP itself, the appropriate forum for such a claim is 'a later proceeding' to show that the
  
  child was denied a free and appropriate public education 'because necessary services
  
  included in the IEP were not provided in practice.'" F.L. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ.,
  
  553 Fed. App'x 2, 9 (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2014), quoting R.E., 694 F.3d at 187 n.3. Therefore,
  
  if the student never attends the public schools under the proposed IEP, there can be no

  implement the IEP. See R.E., 694 F.3d at 195; E.H., 2015 WL 2146092, at *3.
  
           However, the Second Circuit has held that a district's assignment of a student to a
  
  particular public school site is an administrative decision that must be made in
  
  conformance with the CSE's educational placement recommendation, and the district is
  
  not permitted to assign the student to a school that cannot implement the IEP. See M.O.
  
  v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 793 F.3d 236, 244-45 (2d Cir. 2015); R.E., 694 F.3d at
  
  191-92; T.Y ., 584 F.3d at 419-20; C.F.,746 F.3d at 79. In particular, the Second Circuit
  
  has stated that claims regarding an assigned school's ability to implement an IEP may not
  
  be speculative when they consist of "prospective challenges to [the assigned school's]
  
  capacity to provide the services mandated by the IEP." See M.O., 793 F.3d at 246; see
  
  also Y .F. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2015 WL 4622500, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 31,
  
  2015) (noting that the "the inability of the proposed school to provide a FAPE as defined
  
  by the IEP [must be] clear at the time the parents rejected the placement"); M.C. v.New
  
  Y ork City Dep't of Educ., 2015 WL 4464102, at *6-*7 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2015) (noting
  
  that claims are speculative when parents challenge the willingness, rather than the ability,
  
  of an assigned school to implement an IEP); S .E. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2015
  
  WL 4092386, at *12-*13 (S.D.N.Y. July 6, 2015) (noting the preference of the courts for
  
  "'hard evidence' that demonstrates the assigned [public school] placement was 'factually
  
  incapable' of implementing the IEP"); N.S. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2014 WL
  
  2722967, at *12-*13 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2014).
  
           In view of the foregoing, the parent cannot prevail on her claims regarding the
  
  implementation of the April 2013 IEP and/or the assigned public school site.                    It is
  
  undisputed that the parent rejected the recommended public program and instead chose to
  
  enroll the student in a nonpublic school of her choosing prior to the time the DOE became
  
  obligated to implement the April 2013 IEP (Ex. P-H).5
  
           As to the parent’s argument that the student would not have been appropriately
  
  functionally grouped within the proposed                  classroom (Exs. P-A at 2, P-D), the
  
  
  5
   Indeed, the January 15, 2013               indicates that the student has never attended a public
  school program (Ex. SD-3).

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  basis of that concern was an observation of the proposed program in June 2013
  
  (R. 94; Ex. P-D). The parent did not obtain any information regarding the specific
  
  classroom into which the student may have been placed had he attended the assigned
  
  school, or the functional abilities of the students in any such class.     The evidence
  
  contained in the hearing record provides support only for what the parent believed might
  
  occur at the assigned school, rather than evidence that the assigned school was incapable
  
  of implementing the student's IEP. A number of courts have noted the speculative nature
  
  of grouping claims when a student never attends the assigned public school site, and the
  
  parent presents no argument for departing from this authority.      See M .C., 2015 WL
  
  4464102, at *7; R.B. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 15 F. Supp. 3d 421, 436 (S.D.N.Y.
  
  2014), aff'd, 603 Fed. App'x 36; B.K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 12 F. Supp. 3d
  
  343, 371 (E.D.N.Y. 2014); N.K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 961 F. Supp. 2d 577,
  
  590 (S.D.N.Y. 2013); J.L., 2013 WL 625064, at *11 (noting that the "IDEA affords the
  
  parents no right to participate in the selection of . . . their child's classmates").
  
  Accordingly, the parent's claims based on her observations regarding other students at the
  
  assigned public school site generally, rather than with respect to the implementation of
  
  the student's IEP, cannot provide a basis for a finding of a denial of a FAPE in this
  
  instance. See R.B., 589 Fed. App'x at 576 (holding that a parent's observations during a
  
  visit to an assigned school constituted speculative challenges that the school would not
  
  implement the student's IEP).
  
         As the IEP was appropriate to meet the student's needs for the reasons set forth
  
  above, any conclusion that the DOE would have denied the student a FAPE by failing to
  
  implement the IEP at the assigned public school site based on functional grouping or
  
  ability to implement required services would necessarily be based on impermissible
  
  speculation, and the DOE was not obligated to present retrospective evidence at the
  
  impartial hearing regarding the implementation of the student's program at the assigned
  
  public school site or to refute the parent's claims related thereto. See M.O., 793 F.3d at
  
  245-46; R.B., 589 Fed. App'x at 576; F.L., 553 Fed. App'x at 9; K.L., 530 Fed. App'x at
  
  87; R.E., 694 F.3d at 187 & n.3.

    Case No. 155154
  
  
  
          In summary, the evidence in the hearing record establishes that the DOE
  
  offered the student a FAPE for the 2013/14 school year. Having made this determination,
  
  it is not necessary to consider the appropriateness of                  or to consider
  
  whether equitable factors favor an award of tuition reimbursement and/or direct payment
  
  to the private school. See M.C. v. V oluntown, 226 F.3d 60, 66 (2d Cir. 2000); C.F. v.
  
  New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2011 WL 5130101, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 28, 2011); D.D-

  aff'd 2012 WL 6684585 (2d Cir. Dec. 26, 2012).
  
  VI. ORDER
  
           NOW, THEREFORE, IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS OF FACT,
  
          IT IS
  
  HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
  
          The parent’s claim for reimbursement and/or direct payment of the student’s
  
  tuition to               for the 2013/14 school year is DENIED.

   Case No. 160159
  
  
  
         This Final Decision And Order in the matter of Student (“       ”) against the New
  
  York City Department of Education (“Respondent” or “DOE”) is rendered upon
  
  consideration of Petitioner’s Due Process Request; prior proceedings in this matter and
  
  the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et
  
  seq., and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. § 300 et seq., and the New York State
  
  Education Law Educ. Law § 4404 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.5 et seq.
  
  Procedural Background
  
         This matter was commenced on behalf of “           ” (“Petitioner”) a student with a
  
  disability, on April 4, 2016. by filing a Due Process Compliant (“Complaint”) against the
  
  New York City Department of Education (“DOE”) pursuant to the Individuals with
  
  Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”). This Hearing Officer was appointed to preside over
  
  this case on April 4, 2016. Pre-Hearing Conferences were held on May 13 and May 17,
  
  2016. The matter was heard on August 31, 2016, September 7, 2016, September 8, 2016
  
  and September 23, 2016.
  
  Petitioner’s Position and Relief Sought
  
     1. The DOE was obligated to provide             with a FAPE for the 2015/2016 school
  
         year.
  
     2. The DOE failed to provide a FAPE to          for the 2015/2016 school year.
  
     3. The parents unilaterally placed      into appropriate educational programs for the
  
         2015/2016 school year.
  
     4. Equitable considerations favor petitioner.
  
     5. The DOE failed to provide       with Notice and Exit Summary.
  
     6. Remedy: Reimbursement by the DOE to parents for their expenditures for             ’s
  
         private placements for the 2015/2016 school year.
  
  The Doe’s Position and Relief Sought
  
     1. The DOE concedes it did not provide           with a FAPE for the 2015/2016 school
  
         year.
  
     2. The DOE’s obligation to provide              with a FAPE terminated prior to the
  
         2015/2016 school year.

    Case No. 160159
  
  
  
      3. The Parents’ unilateral placements for the 2015/2016 school year were not
  
           appropriate for

      5. Parents should not be awarded reimbursement of their expenditures for                 ’s
  
           private              placements for the 2015/2016 school year.
  
  Issues
  
  As to the 2015/2016 School Year:
  
                 1. Whether or not the DOE was obligated to provide a FAPE to             for the
  
                     2015/2016 school year.
  
                 2. If the DOE was so obligated, whether or not:
  
                        a. the DOE failed in its obligation to provide a FAPE to          for the
  
                              2015/2016 school year.
  
                        b. the schools chosen by Parents were appropriate.
  
                        c. the equities are such to reduce or eliminate an award of a remedy to
  
                              Parents.
  
                        d. Parents should be awarded reimbursement of their expenditures for

  Statement of Law
  
         The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) provides that a child
  
  with a disability is entitled to a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”), and
  
  ensures that included special education and related services are designed to meet “their
  
  unique needs to prepare the child for further education, employment, and independent
  
  living.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). The FAPE providing this individualization must also
  
  conform to an individualized education program (“IEP”). 34 C.F.R. § 300.320.
  
         The IEP must be reviewed periodically, but not less than annually, to determine
     Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                       11
  
     Case No. 160159
  
  
  
  whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved. 34 C.F.R. § 300.324(b)(1)(i); 8
  
  NYCRR § 200.4(f). The IEP must be revised to address: 1) any lack of expected progress
  
  toward the annual goals and in the general education curriculum, if appropriate; 2) the
  
  results of any reevaluation; 3) information about the child provided to, or by, the parents;
  
  the child’s anticipated needs; or other matters. 34 C.F.R. § 300.324(b)(1)(ii); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.4(f)(2).
  
                The IDEA mandates that an IEP be based on the results of the most recent
  
  evaluation of a student.4
  
                The United States Supreme Court established a three pronged test to determine
  
  whether school district may be required to reimburse parents for their expenditures for
  
  private educational services obtained for a student by his or her parent: (1) were the
  
  services offered by the board of education inadequate or inappropriate, (2) are the
  
  services selected by the parent appropriate, and (3) do equitable considerations support
  
  the parent's claim (Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359 [1985];
  
  Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 [1993]; Cerra v. Pawling Cent.
  
  Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 186, 192 [2d Cir. Sept. 28, 2005]).
  
                Parents seeking reimbursement “bear the burden of demonstrating that their
  
  private placement was appropriate. (Gagliardo v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., 489 F.3d 105
  
  at 112 [2d Cir. 2007]).
  
                When determining whether the parents’ unilateral placement is appropriate,
  
  “[u]ltimately, the issue turns on” whether that placement is “reasonably calculated to
  
  enable the child to receive educational benefit” (Frank G., 459 F.3d at 364; see also
  
  Gagliardo, 489 F.3d at 112), i.e., whether it provides ‘education instruction specifically
  
  designed to meet the unique needs of a handicapped child’” (Gagliardo, 489 F.3d at 365).
  
                OSEP advises that, “based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual
  
  case, an impartial hearing officer has the authority to grant any relief he/she deems

  to Riffel, 34 IDELR 292 (OSEP 2000) (discussing a hearing officer’s authority to grant
  
  compensatory education services).
  
                 Where a school system fails to provide special education or related services to a
  
  disabled student, the student is entitled to compensatory education.5
  
                 A compensatory education “award must be reasonably calculated to provide the
  
  educational benefits that likely would have accrued from special education services the
  
  school district should have supplied in the first place.”6
  
                 A compensatory education award is an equitable remedy that “should aim to place
  
  disabled children in the same position they would have occupied but for the school
  
  district's violations of IDEA.”7
  
                 “Because compensatory education is a remedy for past deficiencies in a student's
  
  educational program,” a finding as to whether a student was denied a FAPE in the
  
  relevant time period is a “necessary prerequisite to a compensatory education award.”8
  
                 It is reasonable to determine that a child’s right to compensatory education begins
  
  when a school district knew, or should have known, that a child ’s Individualized
  
  Education Program (“IEP”) did not provide FAPE. (The Third Circuit has addressed and
  
  upheld this view; see M.C. v. Cent. Reg’l School dist. 81 F.3d 389, 395, 396-397 (C.A.3
  
  (N.J. 1996), (“An award of compensatory education may be available for the time when
  
  the District knew or should have known of a denial of FAPE.”) .D.F. v. Collingswood
  
  Public Schools,                     USCA for Third Circuit No.11-2410 (12/9/2011) (Appeal from USDC
  
  NJ).
  
                 Case law in New York has applied a balancing of the equities in terms of reducing
  
  or eliminating an award in cases of net unreasonable parental conduct.9

  school district to fund education beyond the expiration of a child's eligibility as a remedy for any earlier
  deprivations in the child's education”). The SRO has reached the same definition under the rubric of
  “compensatory additional services.” See, e.g., N.Y. SRO Decision No. 13-048 (Sept. 18, 2013); N.Y. SRO

              Under federal law, the obligation to make FAPE available to all children with
  
  disabilities does not apply to those children who have graduated from high school with a
  
  regular high school diploma (34 C.F.R. § 300.102(a)(3)(i)).
  
              Similarly, under New York law, “a student who is otherwise eligible as a student
  
  with a disability, may continue to obtain services under the IDEA until he or she receives
  
  either a local or Regents high school diploma (34 C.F.R. § 300.102[a][3][i]; 8 NYCRR

                  must invite a representative of any participating agency that is likely to be responsible for
                  providing or paying for transition services. If an agency invited to send a representative to
                  a meeting does not do so, the district should take steps to involve the other agency in the

             Post-secondary goals are not required in the area of independent living, unless
  
  appropriate. It is up to the child’s IEP team to determine whether IEP goals related to the

                     student’s academic achievement and functional performance, which must
  
                     include recommendations on how to assist the student in meeting his or
  
                     her postsecondary goals. This Student Exit Summary must be provided to
  
                     a student whose eligibility for special education services terminates due to
  
                     graduation from secondary school with a regular diploma or due to
  
                     exceeding the age eligibility for a free appropriate public education

                     New York State Education Department recommends that a Student Exit
  
                     Summary also be completed for students exiting with a High School

                                   The purpose of the Student Exit Summary is to provide the
  
                     student with a written report that provides essential information to consider
  
                     as the student transitions from secondary school.        The Student Exit

                     recommendations to support successful transition to adult living, learning
  
                     and working. The Student Exit Summary should be designed to assist the

                     supports in postsecondary settings, the workplace and the community and
  
                     to aid the student in accessing adult services as appropriate. It should help

                 A procedural violation alone without a showing that the child’s education was
  
  substantively affected, does not establish a failure to provide a FAPE. See, e.g., A.C. v.
  
  Bd. of Educ., 553 F.3d 165 (2d Cir. 2009) (the failure to complete an evaluation in a
  
  timely manner did not result in substantive harm to the child).
  
                 In matters alleging a procedural violation, an IDEA claim is viable only if those
  
  procedural violations affected the student's substantive rights.14
  
                                A hearing officer may find that a child did not receive a FAPE only if the
  
                                procedural inadequacies--
  
                                               (i) Impeded the child’s right to a FAPE;
  
                                               (ii) Significantly impeded the parent’s opportunity to participate in
  
                                the decision-making process regarding the provision of a FAPE to the
  
                                parent’s child; or

  Findings
  
                     was born on                                 and attended New York City public schools
  
  from                        through                                       .
  
            and at some point was classified as
  
                          .
  
             During                     ,          ’s disability became more pronounced and impede her
  
  ability to take advantage of her education.
  
                                                                                                                 .
  
             In May of 2014,                     was diagnosed as follows:
  
  
  
  
                 .
  
              The DOE provided an IEP dated May 16, 2014, IEP                       ’s 2014/2015 school year.
  
  The DOE failed to timely identify a specific program for                         to attend for the 2014/2015
  
  school year.
  
             In September 2014,                   ’s parents unilaterally placed     into a program at the
  
                                            ,                                          .17

             Both             and               were accredited by appropriate state agencies.
  
             After completing the                                           ,

              . Based upon this progress,                     transferred to the                                     ,

             suffered no deprivation of educational benefit because of these failures.
  
  
  
  
         CONCLUSIONS
  
         The May 16, 2014, IEP (“5/2014 IEP”) was sufficient and appropriate. The
  
  Placement Recommendation,                        Goals, and                      set forth in the
  
  IEP were sufficient and appropriate for       ’s 2014/2015 school year.
  
                                                                                               :

   Case No. 160159
  
  
  
         The equities are such to reduce or eliminate an award of a remedy to Parents. The
  
  Parents’ argument is not reasonable.      It would be unreasonable to uphold Petitioner’s
  
  position that                                      , particularly in light of the findings set
  
  forth immediately above. Moreover, it would be an absurd conclusion that would support
  
  inconsistent and unreasonable actions: If          insists that
  
  
  
                             . Moreover, if
  
  
  
                              , the DOE would be
  
         . The DOE has no such obligation.
  
         CA’s policy -
  
                                                                       -   is not determinative of
  
  whether                                            . Additionally, it seems somewhat vague
  
  and arbitrarily applied, particularly in the present matter.
  
         Moreover, Petitioner misconstrues the law. Under IDEA and New York law, a
  
  school district is obligated to provide special education academic services, and related
  
  services, and transition services until the student is 21 or graduates with a regents or local
  
  diploma. Petitioner erroneously asserts the DOE is so obligated until such time as a
  
  student has earn a diploma and has achieved all related and transitional goals. That is
  
  not the law.
  
                                                                           .
  
  
  
  
                                                                  .
  
         The issue of appropriateness of any program             attended during the time at issue
  
  in this matter, the 2015/2016 school year, is rendered moot upon the determination that
  
  
  
         .
  
         The DOE’s failure to provide an                     and                   are procedural
  
  violations that do not rise to a denial of FAPE and do not support an award of

    Case No. 160159
  
  
  
  reimbursement to Petitioner under these facts, applicable law or equitable considerations:
  
  the obligation to provide a FAPE had terminated;
  
                                                                         ; it would have been
  
  unreasonable for      ’s parents or            to believe that the DOE was obligated to pay
  
  a facility that provided no educational instruction, or to pay for
  
                                        ;   suffered no deprivation of educational benefit.
  
          Neither the facts nor the equities support a holding that the failure to provide the
  
  documents noted above was a denial of FAPE for the 2015/2016 school year.
  
  Accordingly, there is no support for a monetary award of reimbursement.
  
          Compensatory services are not to be awarded here where there is no finding that
  
  the DOE failed to provide a FAPE to an eligible student. The disabled individual may still
  
  require services, and there may be a public agency that provides such service. However,
  
  such services do not include a FAPE and are not to be provided by the DOE.
  
          The remedy in this case is to provide to                        an                  in
  
  compliance with 8 NYCRR § 200.4(c)(4).); as well as any still useful information that
  
  would have been set forth in the Notice required by 8 NYCRR §200.4(i). The purpose,
  
  usefulness and the content of these documents is set forth above in footnotes 11 and 12
  
  and in the related text.
  
  
  
          FINAL ORDER:
  
      1) THE DOE IS ORDERED to provide to                                 an                  in
  
          compliance with 8 NYCRR § 200.4(c)(4).); as well as any still useful information
  
          that would have been set forth in the Notice required by 8 NYCRR §200.4(i).
  
      2) I HEREBY DISMISS all other claims set forth in Petitioner’s April 4, 2017 Due

  INTRODUCTION
  
           On the above dates, I conducted hearings, pursuant to the Individuals Disability
  
  Education Act (IDEA, 20 U.S.C. section 1415 (f)(3) regarding a special education
  
  program, Students with Disability, New York City Impartial Hearing Case # 156531.The
  
  hearings were conducted at the impartial hearing office, New York City Department of
  
  Education, at 131 Livingston Street, Brooklyn, New York.               At the hearing, the
  
  Department of Education, hereinafter referred to as the “DOE” was represented by its
  
  designee                       and the parent was represented by her counsel
  
  
  
  BACKGROUND
  
           The child, hereinafter referred to as      is a                ; as per the Parent he
  
  has
  
          . Additionally, since the end of the 2014-2015 school year, the DOE and the
  
  Committee of Special Education (CSE) denied                special education services. Parent
  
  alleges that in May 2015, the “CSE” declassified her son despite
  
                      . The CSE allegedly ignored the several attempts of his mother to
  
  discuss her son’s needs and instead requested an impartial hearing.
  
           Parent’s counsel maintained that during the 2015-2016 school year, the CSE
  
  continued to ignore                                           . The CSE was provided with a
  
                                                   in December 2015, a                       in
  
  March 2016, and a                                   in July 2016 confirming                  .
  
  No action was taken until the DOE held a meeting in August 2016 to discuss providing
  
        with special education services; however, they refused to provide same.
  
           Parent maintains that as the DOE failed to provide appropriate services to her son
  
  and that she enrolled him in a private special education school. She is seeking tuition
  
  reimbursement from the “DOE”, compensatory services for
  
  for the 2015-2016 school year and reimbursement for an
  
  from November 2015.
  
  
  
  THE DOE’S POSITION

    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
          On September 27, 2016 the DOE was served with a notice alleging that the DOE
  
  failed to provide        with a FAPE, wrongly declassified him and incorrectly found him
  
  ineligible for services. The DOE maintains that it followed the procedures of the
  
  Chancellor's regulations in accordance with the Educational Law and determined that
  
  is a student without an educational disability and ineligible for services.
  
                is a student who's
  
                                                           . Concededly, while
  
                       , his difficulties aren't affecting his progress academically and as such,
  
  is not a child with a disabilities.
  
  THE PARENT’S POSITION
  
          That she is entitled to reimbursement for
  
                                        as the DOE ignored her son’s                           and
  
  provided entirely inappropriate recommendations. Additionally,                  ’s
  
  continue due to the CSE’s mishandling of her son’s educational needs.
  
          Parent also requests that the DOE should be required to provide direct payment to
  
  the                 for her son’s tuition as it failed to provide      with an appropriate public
  
  school placement for the 2016-2017 school year. Lastly, the Parent is seeking a Related
  
  Service Authorization (RSA) for a from a
  
                                     to compensate for the DOE’s failure to provide him with
  
                                     for the entire 2015-2016 school year.
  
  THE DEPARTMENT’S CASE
  
          Ms.                   testified that she is currently employed by the DOE in
  
                as an impartial hearing representative and has been in her position since
  
  August of 2016.
  
  Prior to that she was working as a                               for       and is a        . She
  
  stated that her responsibilities as a                       at          , include
  
  
  
                            .
  
          The witness conducted an IEP meeting for a reevaluation for            ; she was directed
  
  to Exhibit 4-3, and stated that         was described by his teachers and by school personnel

  as                                                      and that he's                      . The
  
  team reviewed a                        that was conducted by a DOE                             ,
  
  teacher reports and progress reports. The witness recalled that              was classified as
  
  “                                 ”. She reviewed a                                  , District
  
  Exhibit 2, and stated that the recommendations were as follows, "
  
  
  
  
                                                                            . Therefore,
  
            , were not recommended.
  
           She recalled that the parents voiced objections and concerns regarding the
  
  District's recommendation at the time of the meeting. Additionally, she was objecting to
  
  the presence of school personnel involved at the meeting; the chairperson, Ms.
  
         explained to her that since it was an IEP meeting, that program recommendations
  
  require that the school have members of the team present. The witness was directed to
  
  District Exhibit 4, the attendance page from meeting, and stated the following attendees
  
  were present:                          a                  , an                           , and a
  
                              or          at the meeting. All teachers and support staff agreed
  
  with the District's recommendation of declassification.
  
           Upon cross examination, the witness stated that the Parent was not present at the
  
  IEP meeting; that she participated on the phone. She recalled a discussion regarding
  
  rescheduling of the meeting and stated that “
  
                                                 . The Parent requested a rescheduling and
  
  stated that she didn’t want the                                  present. She remembered that
  
  scheduling was an issue, but didn’t recall specifics.
  
           Ms.        didn’t remember if there were CSE minutes taken at this meeting. She
  
  recalled that the team reviewed a                       from January 2015, however didn’t
  
  review an evaluation from                                        . The witness was directed to
  
  Exhibit A, she recalled that there was another evaluation conducted by an agency that the
  
  DOE contracted out for, however she didn't review that report as it was deemed not to be

  a good report, and that's why we had another                           ”. She was uncertain if
  
  Exhibit A was the report as she never reviewed same.
  
           The witness believed that the Parent may’ve brought to our attention that the
  
  report was poor and contained several grammatical errors. Consequently, “
  
  
  
                                                    . The witness stated that “
  
                                      . The witness was directed to Exhibit 6 and conceded
  
  that it was reviewed at the meeting and confirmed that the provider was working on
  
                    with the child; he wasn't working on                                       as
  
  the Parent “requested that she shouldn't”. Upon further questioning, the witness stated that
  
  she believed that it was “
  
                                                                       ”. She confirmed that the
  
  report stated that “
  
  
  
                     ."
  
           The witness was directed to Exhibit F, an IEP from April 23, 2014; the mandate
  
  on page 6 provided for
  
           . She was uncertain if this was the last IEP and in effect at the time of time of the
  
  meeting. She was unaware that the DOE had provided an RSA for                                 .
  
  As per Exhibit 2, the witness acknowledged that it indicated that             through an RSA at
  
                               was receiving                             . She conceded that the
  
  team reviewed this report in the meeting. Ms.                testified that as the parent never
  
  shared any documents to indicate that progress was not reviewed; she conceded that the
  
  DOE was paying for the                     and that it was mandated on his IEP.
  
           The witness was directed to DOE Exhibit 5 and it stated that there are times that
  
  “
  
                                      . During the IEP meeting, the witness stated that she
  
  didn’t recall if she reviewed the goals from the prior IEP.
  
  THE PARENT’S CASE
  
           During the 2014-2015 school year,        attended               at                   .

  (Tr. 148: 12-16.) He was classified with                                 and received
  
                                         pursuant to an IEP created in April 2014. (Parent’s Ex.
  
  F, Tr. 149: 4-9.) In December 2014, the CSE initiated a                              of     (Tr.
  
  149: 21-23.)                                              (“         ”), an independent agency
  
  with no relationship to        or the DOE, conducted the evaluation. (Parent’s Ex. A, Tr.
  
  150: 7-9.) The evaluation examined                                            and found
  
                                            which indicated that
  
         . (Parent’s Ex. A at 5.) The evaluation also found that
  
                                                            and recommended that he receive
  
                    . (Id.) After the evaluation was completed, the CSE deemed it
  
  unacceptable. According to the Parent, it was disqualified for                            . (Tr.
  
  151: 5-17.)
  
         A                             evaluator from the DOE conducted a second evaluation.
  
  (DOE Ex. 2, Tr. 153: 4-12.), which indicated
  
                          and determined that                                               . This
  
  confirmed a                                     (DOE Ex. 2 at 4.) The DOE ’s evaluator
  
  determined that                                                than the independent evaluation
  
  from           ; however, the DOE’s report did not recommend                                . (Id

         After the completion of this report, in May 2015, the CSE scheduled an IEP
  
  meeting to review       ’s special education services. The Parent stated that she requested
  
  that the CSE adjourn the meeting to a later date because she could not be physically
  
  present at the meeting as she was traveling. (Tr. 154: 7-18.) The CSE denied her request,
  
  held the meeting and the Parent stated that she had no choice other than to attend by
  
  phone. Additionally, that it was difficult to meaningfully participate by sharing her
  
  thoughts and asking questions to the other individuals involved. (Tr. 200: 18 – 201: 3, 18
  
  – 202: 13.)    At the meeting the CSE only considered the DOE’s January 2015
  
             , and entirely ignored the independent December 2014 evaluation. (Tr. 40: 3-6,
  
  155: 16-21, 156: 8-11.) The DOE’s January 2015 evaluation did not recommend

  (DOE Ex 4.)
  
         The Parent did not agree with the CSE’s decision to declassify her son; although
  
  she could’ve have requested an impartial hearing, she stated that she preferred to work
  
  with the CSE. Following the meeting, the Parent wrote to                           , the            of the
  
  CSE, asking for a second IEP meeting. (Parent’s Ex. G, Tr. 151: 19-20, 156: 18 – 157:

  requesting a second IEP meeting and for an                                                 . (Parent’s Ex.
  
  H.) The CSE failed to respond to the Parent’s request and she sent a third letter on June 5,
  
  2015 (Parent’s Ex. I, Tr. 160: 4-14.) On June 11, 2015, the DOE initiated the impartial
  
  hearing proceeding. (DOE Ex. A, Tr. 160: 21-23

                            . (Parent’s Ex. C, Tr. 305: 2-13.) He recommended that              be

           The Parent stated that she provided both evaluations to the CSE. In December
  
  2015, shortly after she received a copy of               ’s report she provided it to
  
         , who works for the CSE. (Parent’s Ex. K, Tr. 167: 18-23, 215: 16-21, 228: 2-7.)
  
  The CSE did not convene a meeting after receiving                   ’s evaluation. (Tr. 169: 11-

  as the members of the IEP team claimed they did not have the report (Tr. 174: 20-24.)
  
  The Parent maintained that she sent the                     to Mr.       , just as she had the
  
                                     and provided the team with another copy of                ’s
  
  report during the meeting. The team informed the Parent that they were not comfortable
  
  with considering the report as they claimed that they had just received it. (Tr. 175: 14-20.)
  
  After the meeting concluded, the Parent sent the IEP team another copy of                    ’s
  
  report via email. (Parent’s Ex. K, Tr. 177: 7-10. She was never contacted again by the
  
  CSE and an IEP was not created for the 2016-2017 school year. (Tr. Tr. 179 and 180: 3-

         The Parent enrolled her son in the                  for the 2016-2017 school year and
  
  believed it would provide an appropriate setting to address his needs. (Tr. 180: 18-21.)

  FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
         The purpose behind the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is to
  
  (20 U.S.C. section 1400-1482) ensure that students with disabilities have available to
  
  them a FAPE; see Schaffer v. Weast, 126 S. Ct. 528, 531 [2005]; Bd. Of Education v.
  
  Rowley 458 S.CT. 176, 179-81 [1982]; Frang G. v. Bd. Od Edu. 459 F. 3d 356 371 92d
  
  Cir. 2006). A FAPE includes special education and related services designed to meet the
  
  student’s unique need provided in conformity with a comprehensive written IEP            (20
  
  U.S.C. section 1401 [9] [D] 34 C.F.R. section 300.13 see 210 U.S.C. section 1414 ‘d’ ; 34
  
  CFR Section 200-347_. The student’s recommended program must also be provided in
  
  the east restrictive environment (LRE) (20 U.S.C. section 1412 [a][5]aA]; CFR section
  
  300.13 [a][2][i], 200. 1.116 [a][2]; 8 NYCRR 200.6 [a][1]; see Walczak v. Fla. Union
  
  Free School Dist. 142 F. 3d 119, 132 [2d cir. 1998]
  
         The legal standard applicable to request for payment for educational services such
  
  as in this case is well established. A Department of Education may be required to pay for
  
  educational services obtained for a child by the child’s parents if: 1. the services offered
  
  by the Department of Education were inadequate or inappropriate, 2, the services selected
  
  by the parents were appropriate and 3. equitable considerations support the parent’s
  
  claims (Sch. Comm. Of Burlington v. Dept. of Educ. 471 U.S. 359 [1985]; Florence
  
  County Sch. Dist. Foru v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 [1993]; Cerra v. Pawling Center. School
  
  Dist. 427 F. 3d 186, 192 [2d Cir. 2005] “reimbursement merely requires a district to
  
  belatedly pay expenses that it should have paid all along and would have borne in the first
  
  instance had it developed a proper IEP”.
  
         Under the second criteria of the legal standard, the child’s parent bears the burden

   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  of proof with regard to appropriateness of the services which the parents obtained for the
  
  child for the current school year (Application of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 94-
  
  29; Application of the Bd. Of Education of the Monroe-Woodbury CSE, Appeal No. 93-
  
  34; Application of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 95-57, in order to meet that
  
  burden, the parent must show that the services were “proper under the act”, (IDEA)
  
  (Burlington 471 U.S. at 370) i.e. that the private school offered an educational program
  
  which met the child’s special educational needs (Application of a Child with a Disability,
  
  Appeal NO. 94-29). The test for the parent’s private placement is that it is appropriate not
  
  that it is perfect (M.S. v Bd. Of Educ. 231 F. 3d 96, 105 [2d Cir. 2000] cert. denied 532
  
  U.S. 942 2001. The private school need not employ certified special education teachers,
  
  nor have its own IEP for the student. While parents are not held as strictly to the standard
  
  of placement in the LR as school districts are restrictiveness of the parental placement
  
  may be considered in determining whether the parents are entitled to an award of tuition
  
  reimbursement (Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. School Comm. 315 F. 3d, 21, 26-17 [1st Cir.
  
  2002].
  
           The final criterion of ran award of tuition reimbursement is that the petitioners’
  
  claim is supported by equitable considerations (Carmel Centre Sch. Dist. V.V. P. 373 F.
  
  Supp. 2d 402, 416 [S.D.N.Y. 2005] aff’d 2006 WL 2334140 (2d cir. 2006);’ Frank G.
  
  459 F. 3d at 363-64). Equitable considerations are relevant to fashion relief under the
  
  IDEA (Burlington 471 U.S. at 374; Mrs. C. v. Voluntown Bd. Of Edu. 226 F. 3d 60, 68
  
  [2d Cir. 2000]; see Carter, 510 U.S. at 16 [noting that [c]ourts fashioning discretionary
  
  equitable relief under IDEA must consider all relevant factors, including the appropriate
  
  and reasonable level of reimbursement that should be required) such considerations
  
  include the parties, compliance or non compliance with state and federal regulations
  
  pending review the reasonableness of the parties’ positions and like matters (Wolfe v.
  
  Taconic Hills Cent. Sch. Dist. 167 F. Supp 2d 530, 533 [N.D.N.Y. 2001] citing Town of
  
  Burlington v. Dept. of Educ. 736 F. 2ds at 773, 801-02 [1st Cir. 1984] aff’d 471 U.S. 359
  
  [1985]; with respect to equitable considerations, tuition reimbursement may be reduced or
  
  denied when parents fail to raise the appropriateness of an IEP in a timely manner, fail to
  
  make     their   child   available   for   evaluation   by   the   district   or   upon   fining   of

  see Application of the Bd. Of Edu. Appeal No. 04-102; Application of the Bd. Of Educ.

  physical or emotional harm 20 U.S.C. 14122 (a)(C) (iv)(I)(cc)(II)(bb).
  
            The DOE designee stated that to be eligible for FAPE a child must have a
  
  disability that adversely affects their educational performance. The evidence established
  
  that the Parent's claims are meritless in accordance with the IDEA. Therefore,                         's
  
  parents are not entitled to perspective funding and/or tuition reimbursement for the
  
  unilateral placement at the                           for the 2016/2017 school year, nor are they
  
  eligible for compensatory                                              and/or reimbursement for their
  
  private                                          .
  
            Ms.               , the                                 who chaired the CSE review during
  
  the 2014/2015 school year, opined that                    is a student with specific challenges that do
  
  not warrant the exclusion of receiving instruction with typically-developing students. It is
  
  the DOE’s position that the testimony and evidence established that                    is a student who
  
                                                                                              ; due to his
  
                                    , he
  
                                .     In   light       of   these   facts,   and
  
                     , it led the IEP team to believe that he was no in need of special
  
  education services. He was ultimately declassified as an academically-disabled student.
  
            Furthermore as per testimony from                                , the                    who
  
  facilitated the IEP meeting in August 2016 to determine whether or not                          required
  
  special education support to address his                              , that he did not meet the criteria
  
  for special education support and/or services as outlined in the IDEA Section 300.8.. Ms.
  
                    stated that during this conference, the evidence highlighted that                  had
  
                                                                     , which led the IEP team once again
  
  to believe that he did not warrant special education services.
  
            The DOE asserts that they are not disputing                's struggles, however the question

   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  is whether or not he requires special education services and/or related services to have
  
  equal access to the general education curriculum and make meaningful progress as
  
  outlined within the IDEA. Mr.              stated that the Parent answered these questions
  
  best when she stated      "
  
                 . Additionally, the testimony and evidence corroborates Ms. the Parent’s
  
  testimony.
  
         I will not repeat the all details of evidence where but the support and basis for my
  
  findings of fact and decision are grounded in that testimony as it appears above. I have
  
  considered the testimony of all of the witnesses who testified at the hearing. With respect
  
  to the issues presented at the hearing, I make the following findings of fact.
  
         1. I find that the parents have met their burden in proving that the services that
  
               they have unilaterally chosen for    are appropriate.
  
         2. Equitable considerations support the Parent and reimbursement and related
  
               relief is appropriate.
  
         As the State Review Officer has expressly recognized in the absence of evidence
  
  demonstrating that the parents failed to cooperate in the development of the IEP or
  
  otherwise engaged in conduct that precluded the development of an appropriate IEP,
  
  equitable considerations generally support a claim of tuition reimbursement.” See supra,
  
  Appeal No. 05-087 (referencing Application of the Board of Edu. Appeal No. 05-030;
  
  Application of the Board of Educ. Appeal No. 04-091; Application of a Child with a
  
  Disability, Appeal No. 04-049).
  
         When a parent believes a school district failed to provide their child with a FAPE,
  
  the parent may enroll the student in a private school at their own expense and request
  
  reimbursement. An IHO will award reimbursement if he or she finds that: (1) the
  
  educational program offered to the student by the school district was inappropriate; (2)
  
  the program selected by the parent was appropriate; and (3) the equitable considerations
  
  favor reimbursement. Forest Grove School Dist. v. T.A ., 557 U.S. 230, 246-47 (2009);

   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
           In New York, the Legislature has seen fit to place the initial burden on the school
  
  system to prove the appropriateness of both its educational program and placement for a
  
  student. Educ. Law § 4404(1)(c). Thereafter, the burden shifts to the parent to prove the
  
  appropriateness of his/her chosen school for the student and that the equities favor the
  
  parent. M .O. v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ., 793 F.3d 236, 243 (2nd Cir. 2015).       To
  
  meet its initial burden, the DOE must show that “a preponderance of the evidence”
  
  presented during the hearing establishes that the program offered to the student was
  
  appropriate. A .M. v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ., No. 15-4076, 2017 WL 83384, at *14
  
  (2d Cir Jan. 10, 2017). If the DOE is unable to present sufficient evidence to establish the
  
  appropriateness of its proposed program, it cannot meet its burden. Id. (reversing an IHO
  
  ruling because the DOE presented no evidence supporting the appropriateness of its IEP).
  
           As stated above, I find that the DOE failed the provide       with an appropriate
  
  educational program or placement for the 2016-2017 School Year. I agree with Parent’s
  
  counsel that the DOE failed to create a program or provide a placement for          for this
  
  current school year. The DOE maintained that an IEP was not provided to           in August
  
  2016 because his                                        was sufficiently high to not warrant
  
  services. (Tr. 85: 11-16.); the DOE failed to prove same and or provide evidence to
  
  establish the level of        ’s                       during the 2015-2016 school year.
  
  Additionally, I agree that the DOE produced no evidence of his ability to
  
                            .    The only evidence regarding     ’s abilities during the 2015-
  
  2016 school year were provide by the Parent and established that her son had difficulties
  
  with                                                                     . (Parent’s Exs. C,
  
  D, E.)
  
           I concur with Parent’s counsel in that                                            ,
  
  however this fact does not excuse the DOE from its obligation to provide special
  
  education services.      The U.S. Department of Education recognized in Letter to
  
  A nonymous, that students who have high cognition and have disabilities are protected
  
  under the IDEA and implementing regulations. Letter to A nonymous, 55 IDELR 172
  
  (2010) (stating that a student with ADHD could require special education services to
  
  address a lack of organizational skills.)

    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
          The Parent provided the DOE with two evaluations to establish that her son was
  
  struggling during the 2015-2016 school year. (Parent’s Ex. J, K, Tr. 233: 18-23, 273: 7.)
  
  However, when the Parent met with the DOE in August 2016, the team did not fully
  
  review these reports.   The Parent stated that the individuals at the CSE meeting only
  
  discussed the scores detailed in the                                 and didn’t discuss the
  
  diagnoses or recommendations of the report. (Tr. 174: 3-11.        At the IEP meeting, Ms.
  
          , testified to reviewing the report “thoroughly”; however, she didn’t remember
  
                                          or if                 and could not recall the report
  
  detailing his difficulty with                                                . (Tr. 82: 21, 83:
  
  19-20, 104: 18-22, 85: 13-14, 106: 2-5). As per Parent’s counsel, these deficits were
  
  reported upon in the                      section of the                                 which
  
  also explained how
  
                           . (Parent’s Ex. C at 15.) The report indicated that

  (Id.)
  
          Additionally, the IEP team failed to appropriately review                   ’s
  
                                                  which was provided to the CSE in December
  
  2016; both during and after the IEP meeting, the team ignored its results. (Parent’s Ex K,
  
  Tr. 175: 1-5.) This evaluation indicated that
  
                                                                      ; this was the same level
  
  that     was at when he was evaluated in January 2015 (Parent’s Ex. D.) Furthermore,
  
                                                      . (Id.) The evaluation established that he

  maintained that                                                          ; this information was
  
  not considered by the CSE.
  
          The CSE failed to conduct a follow up IEP to discuss that report despite its
  
  promise to do so.

  though that was recommended by                         . (Tr. 131: 23.) Additionally, the CSE didn’t
  
  consider a                                 that the DOE completed in March 2016 (Parent’s Ex.

                                              . (Parent’s Ex. N.) In his                class, he is

                                                                                                    .
  
  (Tr. 382: 4-9, 16-22.)
  
            Dr.                is familiar with the                  having worked with many
  
  students who attend it, and testified that it can provide an appropriate educational setting
  
  for        (Tr. 326: 5-8, 327: 9-10.). He explained that the school can meet his needs and
  
  provide
  
                                                           . Tr. 327: 9-16.)
  
            I agree that the                  is an appropriate placement for         and that he is
  
  making progress. Ms.               testified that she has observed him
  
                        , especially with regard to
  
                                          . (Tr. 386: 7-13.) She explained that
  
               and                                                           . (Tr. 374: 11-13, 386:
  
  19-23.) Although                                                         , the efforts he is making
  
  in this area are helping. (Tr. 387: 4-7.)
  
            Regarding equitable considerations, I find that the Parent cooperated with the
  
  DOE to identify the appropriate special education services for her son. On the very day
  
  that her son was declassified from special education, May 8, 2015, the Parent contacted
  
  the CSE to request another meeting. (Parent’s Ex. G, DOE’s Ex. 4.) After this May 8th
  
  communication, she contacted the CSE two more times to request a second opportunity to
  
  discuss her son’s special education needs as she was concerned about the DOE’s decision
  
  to declassify him. The Parent believed that she didn ’t have the opportunity to
  
  meaningfully participate in the May 8th IEP meeting. (Parent’s Ex H, I, Tr. 201: 18 – 202:
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                              22
  
   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  4.) Instead of scheduling a second meeting to discuss her concerns, the DOE filed an
  
  impartial hearing request. (DOE Ex. 1.)
  
         I find that the Parent again made efforts to cooperate with the DOE in to the 2015-
  
  2016 school year. She received                ’s
  
             and provided it to Mr.            . She also provided Mr.             with her son’s
  
                                    in July 2016. (Parent’s Ex. J.) I find that she reasonably
  
  assumed that Mr.          would share reports with his colleagues at the CSE. The DOE
  
  never contacted the Parent to meet to discuss               ’s report. (Tr. 168: 7-8.) An IEP
  
  meeting   was   not   scheduled    until   August   2016   after     Mr.          received   the
  
                                . (Tr. 170: 11-17; 228: 6-7.)
  
         Incredibly, when the CSE held the IEP meeting in August 2016, the DOE
  
  representatives claimed they did not have                   ’s report. (Tr. 175:1.) After the
  
  Parent again provided the DOE with a copy of                       ’s report during and after the
  
  IEP meeting, the CSE representatives never contact her to discuss the report. (Tr. 179: 23-
  
  25.) I agree that the DOE’s lack of communication with the Parent in scheduling an IEP
  
  meeting and in timely reviewing the evaluations, demonstrate the DOE’s failure to
  
  equitably work with the Parent.
  
         Additionally, the Parent made additional efforts to cooperate with the DOE and
  
  secure special education services for her son were documented in the letter she submitted
  
  to the CSE, through her attorney, informing them of her intent to place her son at the
  
               for the 2016-2017 school year. (Parent’s Ex. L.) As required, she sent this
  
  letter more than ten business days before her son began at the                     on September
  
  8, 2016. (Id.) 20 USC § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(bb).
  
         The Parent expressed an interest in working with the DOE to appropriately
  
  classify her son and identify a special education placement for him in a public school.
  
  (Id.); however, she received no response from this letter and never received any program
  
  or placement for son. (Tr. 182: 20-25.)
  
         It is uncontroverted that the Parent signed an enrollment contract with the
  
         before she met with the DOE in August 2016. However, she stated that it was to
  
  ensure that she had a back-up plan for her son in case the DOE did not appropriately plan
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                         23
  
    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  for hi. She was aware that pursuant to her enrollment agreement she would be able
  
  withdraw her son from the                      any time before October 1st with limited
  
  financial consequences if the DOE provided her son with an appropriate educational
  
  placement. (Parent’s Ex. P at 3-4,Tr. 386: 20-25.) Finally, the Parent stated that she was
  
  aware of her obligation to pay the                 ’s tuition. (Tr. 184: 21-23.) While she is
  
  asking for an award of prospective funding paid directly to the                   due to her
  
  limited financial means, she understands she is bound by the                   ’s enrollment
  
  contract to pay for her son’s tuition. (Tr. 184: 24 – 185: 13.)
  
          New York courts have recognized that parents who cannot afford up-front
  
  payments should not be prevented from petitioning for publicly-funded tuition on the
  
  identical principles facing parents who have paid all, or part, of the tuition prior to
  
  seeking tuition reimbursement from a school district. S abatini v. Corning-Painted Post
  
  A rea Sch. Dist., 78 F.Supp.2d 138, 147 (W.D.N.Y. 1999) (granting preliminary injunction
  
  requiring a school district to pay for private placement and instructing the district to
  
  "make whatever financial arrangements are necessary" to allow student to attend private
  
  school); Connors v. Mills, 34 F. Supp. 2d 795, 804 (N.D.N.Y. 1998) ("It simply cannot be
  
  the case that an act designed to grant 'all' disabled children access to needed services
  
  would undermine that very goal by making such access dependent upon a family's
  
  financial situation.").
  
          I conclude that that the Parent cooperated in working with the DOE in an effort to
  
  identify an appropriate public school placement for her son and that the equities favor her
  
  position.
  
          Regarding compensatory services, as the DOE acted inappropriately when it
  
  decided to declassify      from receiving special education services and that he is entitled
  
  to receive same. The DOE failed to establish a credible reason to discredit the
  
              performed by           . The DOE’s impartial hearing request stated that it was
  
  disapproved due to grammatical, spelling and contextual errors. (DOE Ex. 1.) I agree with
  
  the Parent that the DOE produced no evidence of these errors or how they affected the
  
  substantive conclusions of the report. Ms.             testified that she was aware of the
  
  evaluation, however, never personally reviewed the report and could not explain why it
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                             24
  
    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  was deemed inappropriate. The DOE presented no evidence to explain why the report was
  
  discredited. Additionally, the               report, prepared by an independent agent of the
  
  DOE also determined that               needed                                     because of his
  
                                        . When this evaluation assessed
  
  with the                         , he scored in the                  , however the report was
  
  conducted by a DOE professional which was the only report considered. Despite the fact
  
  that                                         , the DOE’s in-house report determined that
  
  was not in need of                                      ; the report recognized that child had
  
                        , but only recommended that
  
         . I find that                  ’s testimony was credible wherein he stated that this
  
  recommendation is “absolutely no[t] accurate” because
  
                                  and
  
         . (Tr. 258: 19 – 259.)
  
            The team that conducted         ’s May 2015 IEP meeting where he was declassified
  
  from special education, exhibited bad faith when it determined that the
  
                    produced by its own colleague should be afforded more weight than the
  
  report of an independent evaluator. Additionally, the team disregarded a recommendation
  
  within a                              from                    , the school       was attending at
  
  the time of the meeting that was also reviewed during the meeting. (DOE Ex. 6, Tr. 44:
  
  15-19.) Although the provider who wrote this report acknowledged that she was not
  
  addressing                              , she stated that he continued to show a need in
  
  goals. (DOE Ex. 6.) The only recommendation for a decrease in services that this report
  
  made, was that         no longer needed                             to address
  
  goals. I agree with Parent’s counsel that it is uncertain if the IEP team reviewed any of the
  
  goals on      ’s previous IEP, goals that addressed                          , to ensure they had
  
  been met before deciding to declassify him. Ms.                could not identify his previous
  
  IEP. (Tr. 50: 4-6.)
  
            I agree that at the time of the IEP meeting in May 2015, the DOE had more than
  
  sufficient evidence to find that          continued to need                                    to
  
  address                          . The DOE disregarded this evidence and denied              any
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                           25

  special education services.
  
            The IDEA provides that courts "shall grant the relief that the court determines to
  
  be appropriate." (20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)( c) (iii); 34 C.F.R. § 300.516(c)(3).)
  
  Compensatory education is "prospective equitable relief” that requires a school district to
  
  fund education "as a remedy for any earlier deprivations in the child's education." Somoza
  
  v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ., 538 F.3d 106, 109 n.2 (2d Cir. 2008).                ’s April
  
  2014 IEP mandated that he receive
  
            . (Parent’s Ex. F.) As such, to compensate             for the DOE’s inappropriate
  
  decision to withhold these sessions during the 2015-2016 school year when it declassified
  
  him, the DOE should be ordered to provide him with                                          for
  
  the entire school year, i.e.,                , of make-up service.
  
            The Parent is entitled to reimbursement for              ’s
  
                                     . 8 NYCRR § 200.5(g). (Parent’s Ex. D, Q.) The DOE’s
  
                                      from January 2015, which was the only such report the
  
  CSE ever considered, was wholly inappropriate and stands as an aberration among his
  
                       . The DOE’s report ignored the gravity of                             and
  
  provided entirely inappropriate recommendations with regards to addressing such issues.
  
  (Tr. 258: 19 – 259.) The DOE’s reports and recommendations directly contradicted the
  
  recommendation of the              ’s report, which was commissioned by the DOE and took
  
  place just one month earlier. (Parent’s Ex. A.) Additionally, as per Parent’s counsel, the
  
  inappropriateness of the DOE’s evaluation is further evidenced by the fact that a second
  
  independent evaluator,                       , identified   ’s need for
  
             ten months after the DOE’s evaluation. Furthermore,                            have
  
  continued through to the present day, evidencing that the DOE’s January 2015 report was
  
  inappropriate. I again agree with Parent’s counsel in that if the CSE had not disregarded
  
  the           ’s report, and/or if the DOE had conducted a proper evaluation in January
  
  2015, the Parent would not have needed to commission                      ’s report. Therefore,
  
  the Parent should be reimbursed by the DOE for the cost of                   ’s evaluation and
  
  report.
  
            I agree with the parents that   ’s require a                                  school

  setting with
  
            , and all services which can address her needs. I find that the
  
  where he has been in attendance since September 2016 is an appropriate placement for
  
     and that he has made “meaningful educational progress as evidenced by the testimony
  
  herein and by the academic interim report card.
  
  ORDER
  
         For the foregoing reasons, I Order the following:
  
             (1) That the DOE provide direct payment to the                       tuition for the
  
                 2016-2017 school year in an amount not to exceed the sum of
  
                 within 30 days of receipt of final bill.
  
             (2) That the DOE issue a RSA for a
  
                                                                   to compensate for the DOE’s
  
                 failure to provide       with                                     for the entire
  
                 2015-2016 school year.
  
             (3) That the DOE reimburse the Parent in the sum of               for the cost of the
  
                                                                       performed by

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  Introduction
  
  This document constitutes the Decision and Order of the undersigned, the duly designated
  
  Impartial Hearing Officer (IHO) in an Impartial Hearing brought pursuant to the
  
  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the New York State Education
  
  Laws. The School District will be referred to as District, the parent as Parent and the
  
  student will be referred to as Student. This is a reimbursement case. A hearing was held
  
  on March 15, 2016; March 29 , 2016; August 2, 2016; August 16, 2016; September 7,
  
  2016; October 18, 2016; November 2, 2016; November 30, 2016; December 20, 2016;
  
  January 10, 2017; and February 15, 2017.
  
  
  
  Overview
  
  In this Decision and Order I will briefly outline the positions of the parties and review
  
  some student history and will then move to apply a three-prong analysis to this case,
  
  examining first whether the District met its burden to demonstrate the appropriateness of
  
  their program, second whether the           Parent met her    burden   to   demonstrate    the
  
  appropriateness of the placement at Private School, and third whether equitable
  
  considerations favor the District or the Parent in this matter.
  
  
  
  Parent’s Position
  
  In the complaint notice dated March 1, 2016 (Ex. A), the Parent alleges that the District
  
  denied the Student a Free Appropriate Public Education (“FAPE”) for the 2015/16 school
  
  year. Specifically, the Parent alleges that her concerns were ignored at the Student’s CSE
  
  meeting, that the District did not provide an adequate                                    , the
  
  District did not provide a                                                  and a
  
                             , the District failed to provide                  for the Student,
  
  despite discussion about the appropriateness of her classification at the CSE meeting, the
  
  District did not include                       for the                        , the IEP goals
  
  are vague and overly broad, and do not pertain to                                         , the
  
  District did not provide a                    for the Student, and the recommended school
  
  placement did not meet the Student’s individual special education needs.

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  
  The Parent is seeking tuition payment for the Private School where she unilaterally placed
  
  the Student.
  
  
  
  District’s Position
  
  In the due process response (Ex. 8), dated March 3, 2016, the District denied the
  
  allegations. The District offered testimony in support of the validity of its program.
  
  
  
  Student History
  
  At the time the Due Process Complaint Notice was filed, the Student was                    .
  
  The Student attended the Private school for                               and
  
          (TRP 211, 447). The Student received related services including
  
  
  
                                             (TRP 212). The Student was in a class of
  
                            last year (TRP 222). The Department Head testified that the
  
  Student was given related services this way to
  
                                    (TRP 216).
  
  
  
  For a                                  (Ex. 3) dated February 10, 2015, the Student was
  
  evaluated with the                                                                   and the
  
                                                            , and scored in the
  
  
  
  
                 (Ex. 3).
  
  
  
  Analysis
  
  A board of education may be required to reimburse parents for their expenditures for
  
  private education services obtained for a student by his or her parents, if the services

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  offered by the board of education were inadequate or inappropriate, the services selected
  
  by the parents were appropriate, and equitable considerations support the parents’ claim.
  
  Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter. 510 U.S. 7 (1993); Sch. Comm. Of Burlington
  
  v. Dep’t. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).
  
  
  
  Prong I
  
  The purpose of IDEA is to provide students with a “basic floor of opportunity” of access
  
  to specialized instruction and related services that are individually designed to provide
  
  educational benefits. B oard of Education, Hendrick Hudson CSD v. Rowley, 458 U.S.
  
  176, 189-190, 102 S. Ct. 3034 (1982); W alczak v. Florida UFSD, 142 F.3d 119 (2nd Cir.
  
  1998). Neither the IDEA, nor Article 89 of the New York State Education Law, requires a
  
  school district to provide special education and related services designed to maximize the
  
  potential of a disabled student. Nor do federal and state education laws require a school
  
  district to provide the best possible educational program and related services, or match
  
  those services requested by a parent.        Application of a Child With a Disability (City
  
  School District of Buffalo), S.R.O. Decision 04-20 (2004). Rather, the goals and
  
  mandates of the IDEA and N.Y. Education Law are relatively modest: namely, to provide
  
  appropriate specialized education and related services sufficient for the disabled student
  
  to benefit from his/her education. S traube v. Florida UFSD, 801 F. Supp. 1164, 1175-
  
  1176 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Moubry v. Independent School District, 9 F. Supp.2d 1086, 1104
  
  (D. Minn. 1998) (citing Rowley)
  
  
  
  This straightforward obligation of the District is accompanied by the requirement to
  
  demonstrate the appropriateness of the program recommended by its CSE. (A pplication of
  
  a Child Suspected of Having a Disability , Appeal No. 93-9; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Handicapping Condition, Appeal No. 92-7; A pplication of a H andicapped Child, 22 Ed
  
  Dept Rep 487 [1983]).         To meet its burden, a board of education must show that its
  
  recommended program is reasonably calculated to confer educational benefits (Bd. of
  
  Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 [1982]). The recommended program must also be
  
  provided   in   the   least    restrictive   environment   (34   C.F.R.   §   300.550[b];   8

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  NYCRR200.6[a][1]).
  
  
  
  After review of the record, despite my observation that the District has presented a prima
  
  facie case, I ultimately find the District has not upheld their Prong I burden. I start my
  
  analysis looking at the relevant IEP and find that the Present Levels of Educational
  
  Performance (PLEPs) seem to reflect the Student’s attributes, the goals and objectives
  
  speak to the Student’s primary areas of concern, and the recommended program is
  
  designed to encourage more than trivial progress. However, I am persuaded by the Parent
  
  that the District’s plans and provisions for the Student were based largely upon data
  
  collected at the Student’s Private School, and I credit testimony that indicates that the
  
  recommendations based on such data cannot be supplanted and then re-assumed into such
  
  a different learning environment. I also find that, given the Student’s extensive needs, the
  
  District failed to provide an appropriate physical placement to adequately educate the
  
  Student. I will outline this finding below.
  
  
  
  The Relevant CSE Meeting
  
  The                        testified that she requested new evaluations for the Student at
  
  the beginning of 2015, for the Student’s three-year reevaluation (TRP 38). She testified
  
  that the Student’s Teacher from the Private School provided details about the Student’s
  
  functioning in the classroom during the meeting (TRP 46-47). She said the
  
        in the IEP were based on what the Private School staff members said they were
  
  doing with the Student (TRP 47-48).
  
  
  
  The Committee on Special Education (CSE) held an Individual Education Program (IEP)
  
  meeting for the Student on May 1, 2015. The District School Psychologist, the Parent, the
  
  Special Education Teacher, who acted as a translator, the Consulting Teacher and a
  
  subject Teacher from the Private School participated at the Meeting (Ex. F).
  
  
  
  The Parent testified that she expressed her concerns about the Student needing
  
                                                (TRP 454).

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  
  On the IEP that resulted from this CSE meeting (Ex. 1), the Student was given a disability
  
  classification of                        . The program was for
  
  
  
  
  The Parent testified that she did not agree with the CSE recommendation because the
  
  Student was not given                        and
  
          (TRP 455).
  
  
  
  CSE Regard for Parental Concerns
  
  In her Complaint Notice (Ex. A), the Parent held that the District ignored her concerns at
  
  the CSE meeting. However, the record reflects that efforts were made to understand the
  
  Parent’s concerns both prior to and during the CSE meeting. The Special Education
  
  Teacher and translator testified that she contacted the Parent prior to the CSE meeting
  
  regarding an evaluation (TR. 143) and that during the CSE meeting she assisted the
  
  Parent in           , asking her whether she understood and if she had questions (TR. 139-
  
  140). The Special Education Teacher further testified that the Parent contributed to the
  
  CSE meeting and that her contributions were considered by the CSE as they developed
  
  the IEP (TR. 140). Finding the Special Education Teacher’s testimony credible, I dismiss
  
  this claim of the Parent.
  
  
  Goals
  
  
  The                         stated the             goals were created at the CSE meeting,
  
  based on the discussion (TRP 105) and based on the Private School Teacher’s input and
  
  that the                    goals were based on the report by the Private School
  
              provider (TRP 48).

  The                            offered a rationale for taking goals from the Private School
  
  report: There should be overlap between what the Student is learning in school and the
  
  IEP goals (TRP 122). She went on to explain the goals were not related to the school
  
  placement but the area of deficit (TRP 106-107). She also testified the reason the IEP did
  
  not include a            goal, a              , or                goal is because the goals are based
  
  on skill deficits, not content area (TRP 120-122).
  
  
  
  While the District maintains that the goals operate irrespective of placement, the
  
  Consulting Teacher from the Private School testified that the goals which were created by
  
  the Private School need to be provided with the level of support that is given in that
  
  school (TRP 385). She testified that the CSE team members from the District created the
  
  IEP’s goals using the goals from the Private School’s progress report (TRP 382, 388). She
  
  added that they also based the goals on what she and a teacher reported at the meeting
  
  (TRP 386, 388).
  
  
  
  A review of the goals (see IEP, Ex. 1) reveals them to be generally sound, given the
  
  Student’s needs, but I am persuaded by the Consulting Teachers argument that the goals
  
  cannot be simply transposed from one environment to another. However, I do not make a
  
  finding regarding FAPE based solely on this. It is only after the District’s individual
  
  failures are seen aggregately that I make a finding regarding FAPE.
  
  
  
  
  The                           testified the section in the IEP related to                    was based
                                                                                                         1
  on the questionnaire she asked the Parent during the meeting for the
  
  as well as conversations with school staff about the Student’s areas of deficit (TRP 53).
  
  
  1
   The Consulting Teacher testified that the Parent was asked to complete a
  with the help of someone at the meeting and it was not provided before the IEP meeting (TRP 413).
  
  
  The                      stated she did not send the Parent the                      prior to the meeting
  because of her need to complete the caseload efficiently (TRP 103).
      Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                                 12

  She said that she had conducted a                                          with the Student during
  
  the                                          (TRP 54). Here again we see what looks like a
  
  tally in the District’s corner, but further analysis clarifies that this evaluation of the
  
  Student in one environment and the assumption that said analysis will transpose itself
  
  from one environment to another, is equivocal, creating a false sense of equality across
  
  educational environments.
  
  
  
  Again here, I am persuaded by testimony: The                                         testified that the
  
  way that she teaches the skills listed in                                     on the IEP would be
  
  different from the way they would be carried out by someone other than an
  
              because her                                approach includes
  
  
  
                                                                                      (TRP 346).    The
  
                             further testified that the                                 on the Student’s
  
  2016 IEP could not be adequately carried out without direction from a licensed
  
                           (TRP 347-348; 351). I note that the IEP in question does not offer
  
        .
  
  
  
  
  The                                from the Private School testified that the Student has
  
  difficulty with                                          (TRP 307-309). She said the students in
  
  the                    class learned                       such as
  
                       (TRP 306). The                                    collaborated with the Student’s
  
  teachers and service providers in advising them of the skills the Student needed to
  
  strengthen (TRP 313).
  
  
  
  The                          stated that during the IEP meeting they learned the Student was
  
  receiving         at the Private School and the Private School representative said that the
  
  Student needed it, so she requested an                           after the meeting2 to determine the
  
  2
      The                  testified that the Student was not given an                             before

  Student’s needs (TRP 59). She added that the evaluation did not recommend
  
  (TRP 61). 3
  
  
  
  I find here that the District acted to try to get to the bottom of the Student’s                needs but
  
  that their evaluation of the Student was inadequate. In her current environment, the
  
  Student has been assessed in           informally                                          and formally
  
                             (TRP 318), and the                                         testified that the
  
  screening tools used for the District                       were designed for a                 child and
  
  were inadequate to assess the skills of a                            student (TRP 330-332). The
  
                             stated that she would have done an assessment of
  
  
  
                                                            (TRP 334). She considered the District
                                                                                                       4
                     inadequate also because it only assessed                                              and
  
  did not address                                      (TRP 337).
  
  
  
  The Consulting Teacher stated that the CSE referenced the 2013-2014 IEP when
  
  determining the Student’s related services. She reported on the Student’s services at the
  
  Private School and said she did not agree with their not recommending                          (TRP 407-
  
  408).
  
  
  
  I find the record offers sufficient evidence to justify an independent evaluation of the
  
  Student that is mindful of the Student’s                        to assess her
  
  needs. The failure to evaluate based upon the unique needs of this Student contributes to
  
  my finding that FAPE was denied.

      The District            , dated September 22, 2015 utilized

  could not master some items, the evaluator did not recommend     (EX. 12).

      The November 22, 2011 Annual Plan recommended termination of             services because the Student’s
                           were adequate for school-related activities (EX. 16).

      Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  The                            testified that the recommended placement was based on the
  
  Student’s                .   She said the Student requires a            program to meet her
  
  needs, and the team thought a                was the most appropriate ratio (TRP 58). The
  
                          testified that the        is an appropriate recommendation for the
  
  Student and further noted that the Student did not display the kind of
  
                        that a          and       settings are designed to address (TRP 58).
  
  However, the Consulting Teacher disagreed with the CSE recommendation for a
  
           program in a            classroom, testifying that it would not provide a sufficient
  
  level of                         support for the Student to make progress (TRP 398).
  
  
  
  We have one qualified educator saying a              is just right for the Student and another
  
  qualified educator saying it is insufficient. To further muddy the waters, I look at another
  
  aspect of placement that is in dispute: In addition to holding concern about the student-to-
  
  teacher ratio, the Parent also argues that the Student requires a placement in a
  
                 that will give her
  
             .
  
  
  
  The Parent testified that she visited the CSE’s proposed placement for the Student and
  
  responded to her visit with an observation that                                           She
  
  said that the CSE’s prospective placement at a school with around         students would not
  
  be a good setting for the Student (TRP 456-457). Similarly, the Consultant Teacher
  
  expressed concerns at the CSE meeting over
  
             (TRP 401-403).
  
  
  
  The Consulting Teacher noted the difference between the approach of the CSE’s
  
  prospective program and the way the Student’s current placement managed this,
  
  specifically through “
  
                                                                                         ” (TRP
  
  409). The                              testified of the importance of this, saying the Student

  (TRP 339).
  
  
  
  Although the Student’s                                   were discussed at the CSE meeting, the
  
  Consulting Teacher testified that the IEP did not include the                                       that she
  
  reported the student needed, as in
  
                   (TRP 406-407).
  
  
  
  Having heard these varying opinions, I find the District, despite keenly holding to their
  
  position, did not uphold their obligation to prove that the placement they recommended
  
  was suitable for the Student.
  
  
  
  Having found that the District did not uphold their burden of proof with regard to the
  
  Student’s placement and the provision of                 services, and having found that the District
  
  developed its goals for the Student in context of the Student’s current environment rather
  
  than his prospective environment, I find that the Student was, on the basis of these
  
  aggregate failures, denied a FAPE5. I now move to consider whether the Parent’s
  
  placement of the Student was appropriate.

  I must now consider whether the Parents met their burden of proving the appropriateness
  
  of the placement of the Student at the Private School. On Prong II, New York federal

  The Parent has claimed that the Student requires an           and      , while the District maintains that the
  Student does not, claiming that
                     . The                      testified that an      and      were not necessary because
                                                                               (TRP 55). She also testified that
  the Student’s Teacher did not report any concerns with                          at the CSE meeting (TRP 91)
  and said a     is only for
                (TRP 94).
  
  
  Trying to predict                        in a different environment is clearly speculative at best, but I find
  that, given the information and resources available to them, the CSE did not have reason to suspect that an
        and     were needed. Regarding this point, I find for the District.

  courts have held that parental placements are “subject to fewer constraints than that
  
  applied to the school authorities.” S chreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 F. Supp
  
  529 [S.D.N.Y. 2010] The Second Circuit has clearly stated:

                every   special   service   necessary   to   maximize    their   child's
  
                potential. They need only demonstrate that the placement
  
                provides educational instruction specially designed to meet the
  
                unique needs of a handicapped child, supported by such services
  
                as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from instruction.”

  Parents need only demonstrate that the placement provides educational instruction
  
  specially designed to meet the unique needs of a handicapped child. Frank G. v. Bd. of

  The Consultant Teacher spoke of the Student’s need in her placement for
  
                    , the importance of                        in her program, and the need
  
  for                (TRP 399-400). She also stated her concerns that the Student could
  
  regress in                              by being in a                           , as well as

  The Private School
  
  The Department Head for the Private School testified that             students attended the
  
  Private School last year, in grades     (TRP 199).

  The Department Head testified that the Private School met all the Student’s special
  
  education needs and academic areas, related services, and                      (TRP 233).

  The                          also reported progress in       and said the Student showed
  
  improvement in                                     – for example,
  
  
  
              (TRP 338-339).
  
  
  
  
  After reviewing the Student’s needs in relation to the information provided about the
  
  Private School, as well as the Student’s progress, I find that the Parent has sustained her
  
  burden of proof in relation to the appropriateness of her placement of the Student.
  
  
  
  Prong III
  
  A board of education may be required to reimburse parents for their expenditures for
  
  private educational services obtained for a student by his or her parents where equitable
  
  considerations support the parents' claim (Florence County Sch.Dist. Four v. Carter, 510
  
  U.S. 7 [1993]; Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 [1985];
  
  R.E., 694 F.3d at 184-85; T.P., 554 F.3d at 252). In Burlington, the Court found that
  
  Congress intended retroactive reimbursement to parents by school officials as an available
  
  remedy in a proper case under the IDEA (471 U.S. at 370-71; see Gagliardo, 489 F.3d at
  
  111; Cerra, 427 F.3d at 192). "Reimbursement merely requires [a district] to belatedly
  
  pay expenses that it should have paid all along and would have borne in the first instance"
  
  had it offered the student a FAPE (Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370-71; see 20 U.S.C. §
  
  1412[a][10][C][ii]; 34 CFR 300.148). The burden of proof is on the school district during
  
  an impartial hearing, except that a parent seeking tuition reimbursement for a unilateral

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  placement has the burden of proof regarding the appropriateness of such placement
  
  (Educ. Law § 4404[1][c]; see R.E., 694 F.3d at 184-85; M .P.G. v. New Y ork City D ep't of
  
  Educ., 2010 WL 3398256, at 7 [S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2010]).
  
  
  
  Tuition reimbursement may be reduced or denied if parents do not provide notice of the
  
  unilateral placement either at the most recent CSE meeting prior to removing the child
  
  from public school, or by written notice ten business days before such removal, "that they
  
  were rejecting the placement proposed by the public agency to provide a [FAPE] to their
  
  child, including stating their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private
  
  school at public expense." (20 U.S.C. § 612[a][10][C][iii][I] ; see 34 C.F.R. § 300.148[d])
  
  This statutory provision "serves the important purpose of giving the school system an
  
  opportunity, before the child is removed, to assemble a team, evaluate the child, devise an
  
  appropriate plan, and determine whether a [FAPE] can be provided in the public schools."
  
  (Greenland Sch. Dist. v. A m y N ., 358 F.3d 150, 160 [1st Cir. 2004])
  
  
  
  Procedural History
  
  Our narrative in Prong I left off at the CSE meeting. Here it resumes after the CSE
  
  meeting when the Parent’s Attorney wrote to the CSE Chair in a letter dated August 4,
  
  2015 (Ex. E), reminding the Chair of the concerns the Parent raised during the CSE
  
  meeting, and enclosed a copy of the Student’s June 2015 progress report. She requested
  
  an                , copies of the Student’s 2015                                        and
  
                                  in her native language. In the letter, she stated the Parent
  
  visited the proposed placement but found it inappropriate for the Student because of
  
  
  
                                                   . She informed the CSE that if the District
  
  did not provide a timely and appropriate public school placement, the Student would
  
  attend the Private School and the Parent would seek tuition funding and             (Ex. E,
  
  pp. 3-5). The Parent’s Attorney wrote another letter to the CSE Chair, dated August 14,
  
  2015 (Ex. D) stating that she had not received a response to her previous letter, an
  
  authorization for an                , or copies of the Student’s assessments. She notified
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                           20
  
   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  the Chair that unless given an appropriate placement, the Parent would enroll the Student
  
  in the Private School and seek tuition funding and            , and enclosed a copy of the
  
  Student’s final progress report (Ex. D).
  
  
  
  In the letter from the CSE Chair to the Parent (Ex. C), dated August 20, 2015, he wrote
  
  that she had a right to request a reconvene of the CSE and asked her to provide the CSE
  
  with updated material, so the CSE could review the materials and determine if a review
  
  was needed. He wrote the Student’s         services were terminated based on an        annual
  
  review plan, dated November 22, 2011, but added that the CSE would consider the
  
  Parent’s letter as a request for reevaluation (Ex. C).
  
  
  
  In the letter from the Parent’s Attorney to the CSE Chair (Ex. B), dated August 25, 2015,
  
  she informed him that the Parent wanted the CSE to reconvene as soon as possible, and
  
  restated her position about unilaterally placing the Student unless offered a suitable public
  
  school placement (Ex. B).
  
  
  
  I credit the Parent for being active in communicating with the CSE and find that equities
  
  here favor the Parent.
  
  
  
  The Request for the Independent
  
  The applicable federal regulation provides in material part as follows: (1) A parent has the
  
  right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees
  
  with an evaluation obtained by the public agency. (2) If a parent requests an independent
  
  educational evaluation at public expense, the public agency must, without unnecessary
  
  delay, either (i) Initiate a hearing under Sec. 300.507 to show that its evaluation is
  
  appropriate; or (ii) Ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided at
  
  public expense, unless the agency demonstrates in a hearing under Sec. 300.507 that the
  
  evaluation obtained by the parent did not meet agency criteria. (3) If the public agency
  
  initiates a hearing and the final decision is that the agency’s evaluation is appropriate, the
  
  parent still has the right to an independent education evaluation, but not at public expense.
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                        21
  
   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  (4) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation, the public agency may ask
  
  for the parent’s reason why he or she objects to the public evaluation. However, the
  
  explanation by the parent may not be required and the public agency may not
  
  unreasonably delay either providing the independent educational evaluation at public
  
  expense or initiating a due process hearing to defend the public evaluation. (34 C.F.R. §
  
  300.502[b]; see also 8 NYCRR 200.5[g])
  
  
  
  In the face of the Parent’s demand, the District has stood silent. The District has neither
  
  issued payment for the requested evaluation, nor did it initiate a hearing under Sec.
  
  300.507 to show that its own evaluation was appropriate. Given the foregoing, I find
  
  entirely for the Parent.
  
  It is therefore ORDERED
  
     -   The District shall provide funding for an independent
  
                      by a provider of the Parent’s choosing provided that the invoice is
  
         submitted within 90 days of this order.
  
     -   The District shall provide funding to Private School for the 2015/16 school
  
         year.
  
  So Ordered,
  
  Dated: May 16, 2016

  INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
  
          On September      28, 2016, the New York City Department of Education
  
  (hereinafter, “DOE” or “District”) appointed the undersigned to act as the impartial
  
  hearing officer (hereinafter, “IHO”) in a case brought under the Federal Individuals with
  
  Disabilities Education Act [20 USC § 1415(f)(3)] (“IDEA”) and the applicable provisions
  
  of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education [8 NYCRR 200.5] by the parent of
  
                     (hereinafter “the Student”). The Parent requested the hearing by filing a
  
  due process complaint that was filed with DOE on September 13, 2016.
  
          After preliminary and/or ancillary determinations this matter was scheduled for
  
  hearing on March 8, 2017 and March 20, 2017, wherein substantive testimony and
  
  evidence was received by this IHO and more particularly summarized elsewhere in this
  
  decision. The parties elected to provide written summations and memoranda that were
  
  received by this IHO and admitted into evidence as IHO Exhibits I and II. Where
  
  appropriate and after careful consideration of the cumulative impact of the criteria set-
  
  forth in the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education certain extensions were
  
  granted of the timeline. The record ultimately closed on May 1, 2017.
  
  FINDINGS OF FACT
  
  NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CASE
  
          The Department of Education’s first witness was                         who testified
  
  telephonically she is a teacher employed by the Department of Education at Committee
  
  on Special Education             . (T ranscript, Pg. 43) She testified she participated in the
  
  CSE review meeting on February 2, 2016 for a triennial review as the special education
  
  teacher for the Board and the District representative. (T ranscript, Pg. 45) She further
  
  testified she visited                    last year. (T ranscript, Pg. 48) Ms.           testified
  
  she reviewed the current                              and the                            during
  
  the meeting. (T ranscript, Pg. 50) She testified based on the evaluations, the child,
  
                                                                                             .
  
  
  
                               . (T ranscript, Pg. 51 and 52) Ms.          further testified the
  
  parent’s input was in agreement with the school. (T ranscript, Pg. 52) Ms.              testified
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                                     4
  
    Case No. 163221
  
  
  
  that everyone agreed that he would benefit from a                                  , which is a
  
    . The program was
  
                       in addition to the current services of                              . (T ranscript,
  
  Pg. 53) She also testified that they discussed                            at the                    but
  
                                                                   . (T ranscript, Pg. 54) Ms.
  
  testified that                      wanted to make sure
  
                   . (T ranscript, Pg. 55) She testified it was also explained to the parents that
  
                                                                                                         .
  
  (transcript, Pg. 55) She also testified that the IEP created on February 2, 2016 could be
  
  implemented in public schools. (T ranscript, Pg. 56) She further testified she observed
  
             on in the classroom during the 2015/2016 school year. (T ranscript, Pg. 58) Ms.
  
            testified that the recommendation for a                                  was for a
  
                                                               .   (T ranscript, Pg. 71) She further
  
  recommended
  
            . (T ranscript, Pg. 73)
  
            The District’s second witness was                             who testified telephonically

  an individualized curriculum for each student, evaluates the student’s progress three times
  
  a year and participates in all the CSE meetings. (T ranscript, Pg. 112 and 113) He further
  
  testified
  
                                              . (T ranscript, Pg. 115) Mr.             testified the

  testified the school has                                                             (T ranscript,
  
  Pg. 119) He further testified he has known                since he started with the program in
  
  2009 in which he is progressing well.                    was accepted as a student for the
  
  2016/2017 school year (T ranscript, Pg. 121) Mr.                   testified
  
                                   and is currently in a classroom with

  participated in the CSE review meeting on February 2, 2016. in which a                       was
  
  recommended. (T ranscript, Pg. 156) The program recommended was a                              he
  
  felt was not appropriate. (T ranscript, Pg. 157) He also testified there was no discussion

  school because she does not have the money. (T ranscript, Pg. 176) Ms.         testified she
  
  participated in the CSE review meeting on February 2, 2016 via phone where a
  
              was recommended with                       . (T ranscript, Pg. 179) She further

  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
          The purpose of the IDEA is “to ensure that all children with disabilities have
  
  available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education
  
  and related services designed to meet their unique needs.” (Bd. Of Educ. V . Rowley, 458
  
  U.S. 176, 179-91 (1982)) Implicit in the congressional purpose of providing access to a
  
  free and appropriate public education (hereinafter “FAPE”) is the requirement that the
  
  education to which access is provided be sufficient to confer some educational benefit
  
  upon the handicap child. (Id.)
  
          Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §1401(9) and 34 C.F.R. §300.17 FAPE is defined as
  
  follows:
  
          Special Education and related services that are provided at public expense under
  
          public supervision and direction and without charge; meet the standards of the
  
          SEA… include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school
  
          education in the State involved; and are provided in conformity with the
  
          individualized education program (IEP).
  
          In deciding whether the Respondent provided a student with a FAPE, the inquiry
  
  is typically: (1) whether the Respondent complied with the procedures set forth in IDEA;
  
  and (2) whether the student’s IEP is reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                          7
  
   Case No. 163221
  
  
  
  educational benefit (Rowley, supra.). Under the second prong, a school district need not
  
  maximize the potential of child but must open the door of public education in a
  
  meaningful way, and the IEP must provide the opportunity for more than only a “trivial
  
  advancement” (P. v. Newington Bd. Of Educ., 546 F.3d. 111 (2nd Cir. 2008)).
  
         The IEP is “the centerpiece of the statute’s education delivery system for disabled
  
  children” (Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988)). An appropriate educational program
  
  begins with an IEP that accurately reflects the results of evaluations to identify the
  
  student's needs, establishes annual goals related to those needs, and provides appropriate
  
  specialized instruction and related services (see 34 C.F.R. §300.320 (a)) For an IEP to be
  
  “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,” it must be
  
  “likely to produce progress, not regression” (W alczak v. Florida Union Free Sch. Dist.,
  
  142 F.3d 119, 130 (2d Cir. 1998)).
  
         Additionally, each public agency must ensure that, as soon as possible following
  
  the development of an IEP, special education and related services are made available to
  
  the child in accordance with the child’s IEP. In order to implement the IEP, a team that
  
  includes the child's parents determines where the child should be placed based on the
  
  child's IEP. Thus, the placement should not dictate the IEP but rather the IEP determines
  
  whether a placement is appropriate. (Rourke v. District of Columbia, 460 F.Supp.2d 32,
  
  44 (D.D.C. 2006)).
  
         The DOE must ensure that the IEP team reviews a student’s IEP periodically, but
  
  not less than annually, to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being
  
  achieved. Moreover, the DOE must ensure that the IEP team revises the IEP, as
  
  appropriate, to address any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals; and the
  
  results of any reevaluation or information about the child provided to, or by, the parents.
  
  Additionally, if the parent obtains an independent educational evaluation (“IEE”) at
  
  public expense, or shares with the public agency an evaluation obtained at private
  
  expense, the school district must consider the results of the evaluation, if it meets agency
  
  criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE to the child. The
  
  IDEA mandates that an IEP be based on the results of the most recent evaluation of a
  
  student.

   Case No. 163221
  
  
  
         In determining the appropriate placement for a child, preference is given to the
  
  least restrictive environment and the appropriate schools nearest the child's home (Id.).
  
  The IDEA requires that unless the IEP of a child with a disability requires some other
  
  arrangement, the child is too educated in the school that he or she would attend if the
  
  student was otherwise not disabled. In selecting the least restrictive environment,
  
  consideration is given to any potential harmful effect on the child or on the quality of the
  
  services that he or she needs. A child with a disability is not removed from education in
  
  age appropriate regular classrooms solely because of needed modifications in the general
  
  education curriculum (See 34 C.F.R. § 300.116).
  
         In cases where the relief sought is tuition reimbursement or reimbursement for
  
  other services a three-prong approach delineated in Burlington School Comm. V . Dept. of
  
  Education (471 U.S. 359 [1985]) and its progeny has developed. It is therefore necessary
  
  to determine if (1) the services offered by the school district were inadequate or
  
  inappropriate and therefore resulted in a denial of FAPE; (2) the services selected by the
  
  parents were appropriate; and (3) equitable considerations support the parent’s claim.
  
             Pursuant to New Y ork Education L aw §4401(c)(1) the DOE shall have the burden
  
  of proof, the burden of persuasion, and the burden of production in impartial hearings
  
  except for instances where the parent is seeking tuition reimbursement for a unilateral
  
  parental placement and in those cases the parent shall have the burden of persuasions and
  
  the burden of production as to the appropriateness of the placement. The burden of proof
  
  in matters such as this shall only be met upon a fair preponderance of the evidence. The
  
  preponderance of the evidence standard requires that the trier of fact to find that the
  
  existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence (Concrete Pipe & Products of
  
  C alif ornia, Inc. v. Construction L aborers Pension Trust for Southern California, 508 U.S.
  
  602, 622 (1993)).
  
         Unlike other standards of proof, the preponderance-of-evidence standard allows
  
  both parties to share the risk of error in a roughly equal fashion, except that when the
  
  evidence is evenly balanced, the party with the burden of persuasion must lose (Director,
  
  Office of W ork er’s Compensation Program s v. Greenw ich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 281
  
  (1994)).

  DISCUSSION
  
  Provisioning of a Free and Appropriate Education
  
         Almost all requests for relief have a basic threshold question, whether or not the
  
  District provisioned a FAPE for this Student. Pursuant to New Y ork Education L aw
  
  §4401(c)(1) the District must bear the burden of proving that the Student was provisioned
  
  a free and appropriate education. As is in most cases, the Individualized Education
  
  Program (IEP) become the focal point for this determination. If the district presents
  
  sufficient witnesses and evidence to support the claim that the IEP was reasonably
  
  calculated to confer an educational benefit for this Student then the District has met its
  
  burden.
  
         “Reasonably calculated” as the phrase         suggests is not meant to be an
  
  insurmountable burden for the district. The IDEA envisions a collaboration of educators,
  
  diagnostic professionals and the parent’s working together as a team to develop a
  
  program and plan for students with unique and special needs. As with all groups,
  
  reasonable people can disagree as to the “best” or “most appropriate” course of action to
  
  any particular problem. These types of disagreements should be resolved in a
  
  collaborative effort and the leader of the CSE team should attempt to build consensus
  
  among the differing viewpoints. Ultimately, only one plan can be developed and it rests
  
  with the CSE to develop that plan.
  
         If an IEP is carefully and thoughtfully crafted it should be readily clear as to the
  
  reasoning behind the service plan and goals for the Student. In the instant case the central
  
  disagreement of the provisioning of FAPE is that the proposed placement as identified by
  
  the District could not implement the IEP as written. While the parties may continue to
  
  disagree as to the provisioning of services the IEP generated by the District becomes the
  
  minimum the parties should be expected to provide. In the instant case the testimony is
  
  clear that the District’s placement could not implement the IEP as written. The IEP
  
  requires that the Student be placed in a
  
       . The testimony states that the Student would have only received
  
                                        . Moreover the school while offering ESP could not
  
  offer the programming requirements as stated in the IEP.

    Case No. 163221
  
  
  
  Ms.            ’s testimony in the matter appeared to be vague and I therefore am unable
  
  to reconcile that “                ” is the same as the services directed in the IEP.
  
          While minor deviations from the IEP can and should be expected, substantive
  
  deviations in the program and services must be reconciled through the CSE. Any
  
  placement charged with the responsibility of implementing the IEP must make practical
  
  decisions on its implementation, however, they cannot simply make changes unilaterally.
  
          In the instant matter the parent requested a reconvene to address the perceived
  
  deficits of the proposed placement, it was at this time the parties could have reconvene to
  
  discuss the issues and perhaps make modifications should they have been necessary to
  
  ensure the student was provided a FAPE. However, the District declined to do so
  
  dismissing the parental concerns “out of hand”. This sua sponte decision failed to address
  
  the practical limitations of the placement and denied the parent an opportunity to further
  
  participate in the placement decision for the Student.
  
          Based on the foregoing I find that the District failed to provide the student with a
  
  FAPE for the 2016-2017 school year.
  
  The Appropriateness of the Unilateral Placement
  
          With respect to the relief of tuition reimbursement, the regulations and case law is
  
  quite clear, the parent’s shoulder the burden of proving that the unilateral placement for
  
  the Student is appropriate. While the case law that has developed is equally clear that this
  
  appropriateness of the unilateral placement is not as rigid as the Rowley standards for the
  
  District the unilateral placement must be sufficiently unique to address the unique needs
  
  of the Student. Taking this one step further, the unilateral placement must not be “one size
  
  fits all” approach but tailored to address the unique needs of the student and that this
  
  tailored instruction must show some benefit for the Student.
  
          In the instant matter, the parents have established by a fair preponderance of the
  
  evidence the progress that the Student has made while at                                during
  
  the 2016-2017 school year. The Parent’s have further proven that the program is a
  
                           is the fact that
  
  
  
                                                                                          (Ex. E,
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                           11
  
   Case No. 163221
  
  
  
  F; Tr. 115-6). The record also established the unique needs of the Student have been
  
  addressed in individualized and meaningful ways by the school and its personnel in order
  
  for the Student to make progress while at the placement. (Ex. F; Tr. 127-8).
  
         Based on the foregoing, I find that the parent’s unilateral placement is appropriate.
  
  Equity Determination
  
         With respect to the relief of tuition reimbursement an assessment must be made as
  
  to equitable determinations. This determination, in essence is a whether or not the
  
  parent’s acted in good faith with the district. Much like the District is required to not “pre-
  
  determine” a plan or placement before the IEP meeting, so too are the parents required
  
  not to “pre-determine” a particular placement of their child. This requirement embodies
  
  the idea that the CSE meeting is meant to be collaborative approach where all parties are
  
  participating meaningfully.
  
         In the instant matter, the District argues the conclusory premise that the Parent’s
  
  had no intention of enrolling the child in the placement. The basis of this conclusion from
  
  the District relies on the fact that the student was never enrolled in the public school
  
  placement and that the Parent’s have yet to remit meaningful payment to the private
  
  school placement and collection efforts of the school have not been implemented.
  
         While the issues of payment are supported by the record the conclusion that the
  
  Parent’s acted in bad faith and thus equities do not favor them is not. The Parent testified
  
  that had a public school placement been provided the Student would have been enrolled
  
  and no evidence provided by the District even suggests that this statement was
  
  disingenuous of the Parent.
  
         I therefore find that equities favor reimbursement.
