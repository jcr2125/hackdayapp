  Statement of Law
  
         The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) provides that a child
  
  with a disability is entitled to a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”), and
  
  ensures that included special education and related services are designed to meet “their
  
  unique needs to prepare the child for further education, employment, and independent
  
  living.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). The FAPE providing this individualization must also
  
  conform to an individualized education program (“IEP”). 34 C.F.R. § 300.320.
  
         The IEP must be reviewed periodically, but not less than annually, to determine
     Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                       11
  
     Case No. 160159
  
  
  
  whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved. 34 C.F.R. § 300.324(b)(1)(i); 8
  
  NYCRR § 200.4(f). The IEP must be revised to address: 1) any lack of expected progress
  
  toward the annual goals and in the general education curriculum, if appropriate; 2) the
  
  results of any reevaluation; 3) information about the child provided to, or by, the parents;
  
  the child’s anticipated needs; or other matters. 34 C.F.R. § 300.324(b)(1)(ii); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.4(f)(2).
  
                The IDEA mandates that an IEP be based on the results of the most recent
  
  evaluation of a student.4
  
                The United States Supreme Court established a three pronged test to determine
  
  whether school district may be required to reimburse parents for their expenditures for
  
  private educational services obtained for a student by his or her parent: (1) were the
  
  services offered by the board of education inadequate or inappropriate, (2) are the
  
  services selected by the parent appropriate, and (3) do equitable considerations support
  
  the parent's claim (Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359 [1985];
  
  Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 [1993]; Cerra v. Pawling Cent.
  
  Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 186, 192 [2d Cir. Sept. 28, 2005]).
  
                Parents seeking reimbursement “bear the burden of demonstrating that their
  
  private placement was appropriate. (Gagliardo v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., 489 F.3d 105
  
  at 112 [2d Cir. 2007]).
  
                When determining whether the parents’ unilateral placement is appropriate,
  
  “[u]ltimately, the issue turns on” whether that placement is “reasonably calculated to
  
  enable the child to receive educational benefit” (Frank G., 459 F.3d at 364; see also
  
  Gagliardo, 489 F.3d at 112), i.e., whether it provides ‘education instruction specifically
  
  designed to meet the unique needs of a handicapped child’” (Gagliardo, 489 F.3d at 365).
  
                OSEP advises that, “based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual
  
  case, an impartial hearing officer has the authority to grant any relief he/she deems
  
  necessary, inclusive of compensatory education, to ensure that a child receives the FAPE
  
  to which he/she is entitled.” (Letter to Kohn, 17 IDELR 522 (OSEP 1991). See also Letter
  
  
  
  4 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.324(a)(1) and (2); see also 8 NYCRR §§ 200.4(d)(2) and (3).

      Case No. 160159
  
  
  
  to Riffel, 34 IDELR 292 (OSEP 2000) (discussing a hearing officer’s authority to grant
  
  compensatory education services).
  
                 Where a school system fails to provide special education or related services to a
  
  disabled student, the student is entitled to compensatory education.5
  
                 A compensatory education “award must be reasonably calculated to provide the
  
  educational benefits that likely would have accrued from special education services the
  
  school district should have supplied in the first place.”6
  
                 A compensatory education award is an equitable remedy that “should aim to place
  
  disabled children in the same position they would have occupied but for the school
  
  district's violations of IDEA.”7
  
                 “Because compensatory education is a remedy for past deficiencies in a student's
  
  educational program,” a finding as to whether a student was denied a FAPE in the
  
  relevant time period is a “necessary prerequisite to a compensatory education award.”8
  
                 It is reasonable to determine that a child’s right to compensatory education begins
  
  when a school district knew, or should have known, that a child ’s Individualized
  
  Education Program (“IEP”) did not provide FAPE. (The Third Circuit has addressed and
  
  upheld this view; see M.C. v. Cent. Reg’l School dist. 81 F.3d 389, 395, 396-397 (C.A.3
  
  (N.J. 1996), (“An award of compensatory education may be available for the time when
  
  the District knew or should have known of a denial of FAPE.”) .D.F. v. Collingswood
  
  Public Schools,                     USCA for Third Circuit No.11-2410 (12/9/2011) (Appeal from USDC
  
  NJ).
  
                 Case law in New York has applied a balancing of the equities in terms of reducing
  
  or eliminating an award in cases of net unreasonable parental conduct.9

  school district to fund education beyond the expiration of a child's eligibility as a remedy for any earlier
  deprivations in the child's education”). The SRO has reached the same definition under the rubric of
  “compensatory additional services.” See, e.g., N.Y. SRO Decision No. 13-048 (Sept. 18, 2013); N.Y. SRO
  Decision No. 12-235 (Sept. 3, 2013) (“an equitable remedy that is tailored to meet the Unique

    Case No. 160159
  
  
  
              Under federal law, the obligation to make FAPE available to all children with
  
  disabilities does not apply to those children who have graduated from high school with a
  
  regular high school diploma (34 C.F.R. § 300.102(a)(3)(i)).
  
              Similarly, under New York law, “a student who is otherwise eligible as a student
  
  with a disability, may continue to obtain services under the IDEA until he or she receives
  
  either a local or Regents high school diploma (34 C.F.R. § 300.102[a][3][i]; 8 NYCRR

                  must invite a representative of any participating agency that is likely to be responsible for
                  providing or paying for transition services. If an agency invited to send a representative to
                  a meeting does not do so, the district should take steps to involve the other agency in the
                  planning of any transition services;

                  initiate a meeting to identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives and, if
                  necessary, revise the student's IEP. Nothing in this Part shall relieve any participating

             Post-secondary goals are not required in the area of independent living, unless
  
  appropriate. It is up to the child’s IEP team to determine whether IEP goals related to the
  
  development of independent living skills are appropriate and necessary for the child to
  
  receive FAPE. (Analysis and Comments to the Regulations, cited immediately above.)
  
             The DOE must provide written notice of the date upon which the student will no
  
  longer be entitled to receive tuition free educational services by reason of receipt of a high
  
  school diploma.11
  
  
  
             Upon graduation from secondary school with a regular diploma, or due to
  
  exceeding the age eligibility for FAPE under State law, the school district must provide
  
  the child with a summary of the child ’s academic achievement and functional
  
  performance, which must include recommendations on how to assist the child in meeting
  
  the child’s postsecondary goals. (34 C.F.R. § 300.305(e)(3).

             student attains the age of 21, a determination of the student's need for adult services and a
             recommendation of all appropriate programs operated, approved, authorized, or licensed by that
             agency which may be available when the student becomes ineligible for tuition-free educational

       Case No. 160159
  
  
  
             New York State must, and does, comply.12 New York State Education Department
  
  (“NYSED”) advises:
  
                             The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) §614(c)(5)
  
                     and State regulations (§200.4(c)(4)) require the local educational agency
  
                     (LEA) to provide a student with a disability with a summary of the
  
                     student’s academic achievement and functional performance, which must
  
                     include recommendations on how to assist the student in meeting his or
  
                     her postsecondary goals. This Student Exit Summary must be provided to
  
                     a student whose eligibility for special education services terminates due to
  
                     graduation from secondary school with a regular diploma or due to
  
                     exceeding the age eligibility for a free appropriate public education
  
                     (FAPE) under State law. This includes students exiting school with a
  
                     Regents, local, and Individualized Education Program (IEP) Diploma. The
  
                     New York State Education Department recommends that a Student Exit
  
                     Summary also be completed for students exiting with a High School
  
                     Equivalency Diploma.
  
                                   The purpose of the Student Exit Summary is to provide the
  
                     student with a written report that provides essential information to consider
  
                     as the student transitions from secondary school.        The Student Exit
  
                     Summary should be a useful and relevant document that summarizes
  
                     individual student abilities, skills, needs and limitations and provides
  
                     recommendations to support successful transition to adult living, learning
  
                     and working. The Student Exit Summary should be designed to assist the
  
                     student in establishing eligibility for reasonable accommodations and
  
                     supports in postsecondary settings, the workplace and the community and
  
                     to aid the student in accessing adult services as appropriate. It should help
  
                     the student better understand the impact of his/her disability and articulate

                 A procedural violation alone without a showing that the child’s education was
  
  substantively affected, does not establish a failure to provide a FAPE. See, e.g., A.C. v.
  
  Bd. of Educ., 553 F.3d 165 (2d Cir. 2009) (the failure to complete an evaluation in a
  
  timely manner did not result in substantive harm to the child).
  
                 In matters alleging a procedural violation, an IDEA claim is viable only if those
  
  procedural violations affected the student's substantive rights.14
  
                                A hearing officer may find that a child did not receive a FAPE only if the
  
                                procedural inadequacies--
  
                                               (i) Impeded the child’s right to a FAPE;
  
                                               (ii) Significantly impeded the parent’s opportunity to participate in
  
                                the decision-making process regarding the provision of a FAPE to the
  
                                parent’s child; or
  
                                               (iii)Caused a deprivation of educational benefit. 15

             During                     ,          ’s disability became more pronounced and impede her
  
  ability to take advantage of her education.

             In May of 2014,                     was diagnosed as follows:
  
  
  
  
                 .
  
              The DOE provided an IEP dated May 16, 2014, IEP                       ’s 2014/2015 school year.
  
  The DOE failed to timely identify a specific program for                         to attend for the 2014/2015
  
  school year.
  
             In September 2014,                   ’s parents unilaterally placed     into a program at the

   Case No. 160159
  
  
  
         The equities are such to reduce or eliminate an award of a remedy to Parents. The
  
  Parents’ argument is not reasonable.      It would be unreasonable to uphold Petitioner’s
  
  position that                                      , particularly in light of the findings set
  
  forth immediately above. Moreover, it would be an absurd conclusion that would support
  
  inconsistent and unreasonable actions: If          insists that
  
  
  
                             . Moreover, if
  
  
  
                              , the DOE would be
  
         . The DOE has no such obligation.
  
         CA’s policy -
  
                                                                       -   is not determinative of
  
  whether                                            . Additionally, it seems somewhat vague
  
  and arbitrarily applied, particularly in the present matter.
  
         Moreover, Petitioner misconstrues the law. Under IDEA and New York law, a
  
  school district is obligated to provide special education academic services, and related
  
  services, and transition services until the student is 21 or graduates with a regents or local
  
  diploma. Petitioner erroneously asserts the DOE is so obligated until such time as a
  
  student has earn a diploma and has achieved all related and transitional goals. That is
  
  not the law.
  
                                                                           .
  
  
  
  
                                                                  .
  
         The issue of appropriateness of any program             attended during the time at issue
  
  in this matter, the 2015/2016 school year, is rendered moot upon the determination that
  
  
  
         .
  
         The DOE’s failure to provide an                     and                   are procedural
  
  violations that do not rise to a denial of FAPE and do not support an award of

  reimbursement to Petitioner under these facts, applicable law or equitable considerations:
  
  the obligation to provide a FAPE had terminated;
  
                                                                         ; it would have been
  
  unreasonable for      ’s parents or            to believe that the DOE was obligated to pay
  
  a facility that provided no educational instruction, or to pay for
  
                                        ;   suffered no deprivation of educational benefit.
  
          Neither the facts nor the equities support a holding that the failure to provide the
  
  documents noted above was a denial of FAPE for the 2015/2016 school year.
  
  Accordingly, there is no support for a monetary award of reimbursement.
  
          Compensatory services are not to be awarded here where there is no finding that
  
  the DOE failed to provide a FAPE to an eligible student. The disabled individual may still
  
  require services, and there may be a public agency that provides such service. However,
  
  such services do not include a FAPE and are not to be provided by the DOE.
  
          The remedy in this case is to provide to                        an                  in
  
  compliance with 8 NYCRR § 200.4(c)(4).); as well as any still useful information that
  
  would have been set forth in the Notice required by 8 NYCRR §200.4(i). The purpose,
