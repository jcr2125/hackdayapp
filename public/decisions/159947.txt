   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  Introduction
  
  This document constitutes the Decision and Order of the undersigned, the duly designated
  
  Impartial Hearing Officer (IHO) in an Impartial Hearing brought pursuant to the
  
  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the New York State Education
  
  Laws. The School District will be referred to as District, the parent as Parent and the
  
  student will be referred to as Student. This is a reimbursement case. A hearing was held
  
  on March 15, 2016; March 29 , 2016; August 2, 2016; August 16, 2016; September 7,
  
  2016; October 18, 2016; November 2, 2016; November 30, 2016; December 20, 2016;
  
  January 10, 2017; and February 15, 2017.
  
  
  
  Overview
  
  In this Decision and Order I will briefly outline the positions of the parties and review
  
  some student history and will then move to apply a three-prong analysis to this case,
  
  examining first whether the District met its burden to demonstrate the appropriateness of
  
  their program, second whether the           Parent met her    burden   to   demonstrate    the
  
  appropriateness of the placement at Private School, and third whether equitable
  
  considerations favor the District or the Parent in this matter.
  
  
  
  Parent’s Position
  
  In the complaint notice dated March 1, 2016 (Ex. A), the Parent alleges that the District
  
  denied the Student a Free Appropriate Public Education (“FAPE”) for the 2015/16 school
  
  year. Specifically, the Parent alleges that her concerns were ignored at the Student’s CSE
  
  meeting, that the District did not provide an adequate                                    , the
  
  District did not provide a                                                  and a
  
                             , the District failed to provide                  for the Student,
  
  despite discussion about the appropriateness of her classification at the CSE meeting, the
  
  District did not include                       for the                        , the IEP goals
  
  are vague and overly broad, and do not pertain to                                         , the
  
  District did not provide a                    for the Student, and the recommended school
  
  placement did not meet the Student’s individual special education needs.

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  
  The Parent is seeking tuition payment for the Private School where she unilaterally placed
  
  the Student.
  
  
  
  District’s Position
  
  In the due process response (Ex. 8), dated March 3, 2016, the District denied the
  
  allegations. The District offered testimony in support of the validity of its program.
  
  
  
  Student History
  
  At the time the Due Process Complaint Notice was filed, the Student was                    .
  
  The Student attended the Private school for                               and
  
          (TRP 211, 447). The Student received related services including
  
  
  
                                             (TRP 212). The Student was in a class of
  
                            last year (TRP 222). The Department Head testified that the
  
  Student was given related services this way to
  
                                    (TRP 216).
  
  
  
  For a                                  (Ex. 3) dated February 10, 2015, the Student was
  
  evaluated with the                                                                   and the
  
                                                            , and scored in the
  
  
  
  
                 (Ex. 3).
  
  
  
  Analysis
  
  A board of education may be required to reimburse parents for their expenditures for
  
  private education services obtained for a student by his or her parents, if the services

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  offered by the board of education were inadequate or inappropriate, the services selected
  
  by the parents were appropriate, and equitable considerations support the parents’ claim.
  
  Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter. 510 U.S. 7 (1993); Sch. Comm. Of Burlington
  
  v. Dep’t. of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).
  
  
  
  Prong I
  
  The purpose of IDEA is to provide students with a “basic floor of opportunity” of access
  
  to specialized instruction and related services that are individually designed to provide
  
  educational benefits. B oard of Education, Hendrick Hudson CSD v. Rowley, 458 U.S.
  
  176, 189-190, 102 S. Ct. 3034 (1982); W alczak v. Florida UFSD, 142 F.3d 119 (2nd Cir.
  
  1998). Neither the IDEA, nor Article 89 of the New York State Education Law, requires a
  
  school district to provide special education and related services designed to maximize the
  
  potential of a disabled student. Nor do federal and state education laws require a school
  
  district to provide the best possible educational program and related services, or match
  
  those services requested by a parent.        Application of a Child With a Disability (City
  
  School District of Buffalo), S.R.O. Decision 04-20 (2004). Rather, the goals and
  
  mandates of the IDEA and N.Y. Education Law are relatively modest: namely, to provide
  
  appropriate specialized education and related services sufficient for the disabled student
  
  to benefit from his/her education. S traube v. Florida UFSD, 801 F. Supp. 1164, 1175-
  
  1176 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Moubry v. Independent School District, 9 F. Supp.2d 1086, 1104
  
  (D. Minn. 1998) (citing Rowley)
  
  
  
  This straightforward obligation of the District is accompanied by the requirement to
  
  demonstrate the appropriateness of the program recommended by its CSE. (A pplication of
  
  a Child Suspected of Having a Disability , Appeal No. 93-9; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Handicapping Condition, Appeal No. 92-7; A pplication of a H andicapped Child, 22 Ed
  
  Dept Rep 487 [1983]).         To meet its burden, a board of education must show that its
  
  recommended program is reasonably calculated to confer educational benefits (Bd. of
  
  Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 [1982]). The recommended program must also be
  
  provided   in   the   least    restrictive   environment   (34   C.F.R.   §   300.550[b];   8

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  NYCRR200.6[a][1]).
  
  
  
  After review of the record, despite my observation that the District has presented a prima
  
  facie case, I ultimately find the District has not upheld their Prong I burden. I start my
  
  analysis looking at the relevant IEP and find that the Present Levels of Educational
  
  Performance (PLEPs) seem to reflect the Student’s attributes, the goals and objectives
  
  speak to the Student’s primary areas of concern, and the recommended program is
  
  designed to encourage more than trivial progress. However, I am persuaded by the Parent
  
  that the District’s plans and provisions for the Student were based largely upon data
  
  collected at the Student’s Private School, and I credit testimony that indicates that the
  
  recommendations based on such data cannot be supplanted and then re-assumed into such
  
  a different learning environment. I also find that, given the Student’s extensive needs, the
  
  District failed to provide an appropriate physical placement to adequately educate the
  
  Student. I will outline this finding below.
  
  
  
  The Relevant CSE Meeting
  
  The                        testified that she requested new evaluations for the Student at
  
  the beginning of 2015, for the Student’s three-year reevaluation (TRP 38). She testified
  
  that the Student’s Teacher from the Private School provided details about the Student’s
  
  functioning in the classroom during the meeting (TRP 46-47). She said the
  
        in the IEP were based on what the Private School staff members said they were
  
  doing with the Student (TRP 47-48).
  
  
  
  The Committee on Special Education (CSE) held an Individual Education Program (IEP)
  
  meeting for the Student on May 1, 2015. The District School Psychologist, the Parent, the
  
  Special Education Teacher, who acted as a translator, the Consulting Teacher and a
  
  subject Teacher from the Private School participated at the Meeting (Ex. F).
  
  
  
  The Parent testified that she expressed her concerns about the Student needing
  
                                                (TRP 454).

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  
  On the IEP that resulted from this CSE meeting (Ex. 1), the Student was given a disability
  
  classification of                        . The program was for
  
  
  
  
  The Parent testified that she did not agree with the CSE recommendation because the
  
  Student was not given                        and
  
          (TRP 455).
  
  
  
  CSE Regard for Parental Concerns
  
  In her Complaint Notice (Ex. A), the Parent held that the District ignored her concerns at
  
  the CSE meeting. However, the record reflects that efforts were made to understand the
  
  Parent’s concerns both prior to and during the CSE meeting. The Special Education
  
  Teacher and translator testified that she contacted the Parent prior to the CSE meeting
  
  regarding an evaluation (TR. 143) and that during the CSE meeting she assisted the
  
  Parent in           , asking her whether she understood and if she had questions (TR. 139-
  
  140). The Special Education Teacher further testified that the Parent contributed to the
  
  CSE meeting and that her contributions were considered by the CSE as they developed
  
  the IEP (TR. 140). Finding the Special Education Teacher’s testimony credible, I dismiss
  
  this claim of the Parent.
  
  
  Goals
  
  
  The                         stated the             goals were created at the CSE meeting,
  
  based on the discussion (TRP 105) and based on the Private School Teacher’s input and
  
  that the                    goals were based on the report by the Private School
  
              provider (TRP 48).
      Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                                  11
  
      Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  The                            offered a rationale for taking goals from the Private School
  
  report: There should be overlap between what the Student is learning in school and the
  
  IEP goals (TRP 122). She went on to explain the goals were not related to the school
  
  placement but the area of deficit (TRP 106-107). She also testified the reason the IEP did
  
  not include a            goal, a              , or                goal is because the goals are based
  
  on skill deficits, not content area (TRP 120-122).
  
  
  
  While the District maintains that the goals operate irrespective of placement, the
  
  Consulting Teacher from the Private School testified that the goals which were created by
  
  the Private School need to be provided with the level of support that is given in that
  
  school (TRP 385). She testified that the CSE team members from the District created the
  
  IEP’s goals using the goals from the Private School’s progress report (TRP 382, 388). She
  
  added that they also based the goals on what she and a teacher reported at the meeting
  
  (TRP 386, 388).
  
  
  
  A review of the goals (see IEP, Ex. 1) reveals them to be generally sound, given the
  
  Student’s needs, but I am persuaded by the Consulting Teachers argument that the goals
  
  cannot be simply transposed from one environment to another. However, I do not make a
  
  finding regarding FAPE based solely on this. It is only after the District’s individual
  
  failures are seen aggregately that I make a finding regarding FAPE.

   The Consulting Teacher testified that the Parent was asked to complete a

  The                      stated she did not send the Parent the                      prior to the meeting

  She said that she had conducted a                                          with the Student during
  
  the                                          (TRP 54). Here again we see what looks like a
  
  tally in the District’s corner, but further analysis clarifies that this evaluation of the
  
  Student in one environment and the assumption that said analysis will transpose itself
  
  from one environment to another, is equivocal, creating a false sense of equality across
  
  educational environments.
  
  
  
  Again here, I am persuaded by testimony: The                                         testified that the
  
  way that she teaches the skills listed in                                     on the IEP would be
  
  different from the way they would be carried out by someone other than an
  
              because her                                approach includes

                             further testified that the                                 on the Student’s
  
  2016 IEP could not be adequately carried out without direction from a licensed
  
                           (TRP 347-348; 351). I note that the IEP in question does not offer
  
        .
  
  
  
  
  The                                from the Private School testified that the Student has
  
  difficulty with                                          (TRP 307-309). She said the students in
  
  the                    class learned                       such as
  
                       (TRP 306). The                                    collaborated with the Student’s
  
  teachers and service providers in advising them of the skills the Student needed to
  
  strengthen (TRP 313).
  
  
  
  The                          stated that during the IEP meeting they learned the Student was
  
  receiving         at the Private School and the Private School representative said that the
  
  Student needed it, so she requested an                           after the meeting2 to determine the

  Student’s needs (TRP 59). She added that the evaluation did not recommend

  I find here that the District acted to try to get to the bottom of the Student’s                needs but
  
  that their evaluation of the Student was inadequate. In her current environment, the
  
  Student has been assessed in           informally                                          and formally
  
                             (TRP 318), and the                                         testified that the
  
  screening tools used for the District                       were designed for a                 child and
  
  were inadequate to assess the skills of a                            student (TRP 330-332). The
  
                             stated that she would have done an assessment of
  
  
  
                                                            (TRP 334). She considered the District
                                                                                                       4
                     inadequate also because it only assessed                                              and
  
  did not address                                      (TRP 337).
  
  
  
  The Consulting Teacher stated that the CSE referenced the 2013-2014 IEP when
  
  determining the Student’s related services. She reported on the Student’s services at the
  
  Private School and said she did not agree with their not recommending                          (TRP 407-
  
  408).
  
  
  
  I find the record offers sufficient evidence to justify an independent evaluation of the
  
  Student that is mindful of the Student’s                        to assess her
  
  needs. The failure to evaluate based upon the unique needs of this Student contributes to
  
  my finding that FAPE was denied.

  could not master some items, the evaluator did not recommend     (EX. 12).

      The November 22, 2011 Annual Plan recommended termination of             services because the Student’s
                           were adequate for school-related activities (EX. 16).

      Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  The                            testified that the recommended placement was based on the
  
  Student’s                .   She said the Student requires a            program to meet her
  
  needs, and the team thought a                was the most appropriate ratio (TRP 58). The
  
                          testified that the        is an appropriate recommendation for the
  
  Student and further noted that the Student did not display the kind of
  
                        that a          and       settings are designed to address (TRP 58).
  
  However, the Consulting Teacher disagreed with the CSE recommendation for a
  
           program in a            classroom, testifying that it would not provide a sufficient
  
  level of                         support for the Student to make progress (TRP 398).
  
  
  
  We have one qualified educator saying a              is just right for the Student and another
  
  qualified educator saying it is insufficient. To further muddy the waters, I look at another
  
  aspect of placement that is in dispute: In addition to holding concern about the student-to-
  
  teacher ratio, the Parent also argues that the Student requires a placement in a
  
                 that will give her
  
             .
  
  
  
  The Parent testified that she visited the CSE’s proposed placement for the Student and
  
  responded to her visit with an observation that                                           She
  
  said that the CSE’s prospective placement at a school with around         students would not
  
  be a good setting for the Student (TRP 456-457). Similarly, the Consultant Teacher
  
  expressed concerns at the CSE meeting over
  
             (TRP 401-403).
  
  
  
  The Consulting Teacher noted the difference between the approach of the CSE’s
  
  prospective program and the way the Student’s current placement managed this,
  
  specifically through “

  (TRP 339).
  
  
  
  Although the Student’s                                   were discussed at the CSE meeting, the
  
  Consulting Teacher testified that the IEP did not include the                                       that she
  
  reported the student needed, as in
  
                   (TRP 406-407).
  
  
  
  Having heard these varying opinions, I find the District, despite keenly holding to their
  
  position, did not uphold their obligation to prove that the placement they recommended
  
  was suitable for the Student.
  
  
  
  Having found that the District did not uphold their burden of proof with regard to the
  
  Student’s placement and the provision of                 services, and having found that the District
  
  developed its goals for the Student in context of the Student’s current environment rather
  
  than his prospective environment, I find that the Student was, on the basis of these
  
  aggregate failures, denied a FAPE5. I now move to consider whether the Parent’s
  
  placement of the Student was appropriate.

  I must now consider whether the Parents met their burden of proving the appropriateness
  
  of the placement of the Student at the Private School. On Prong II, New York federal

  The Parent has claimed that the Student requires an           and      , while the District maintains that the
  Student does not, claiming that
                     . The                      testified that an      and      were not necessary because
                                                                               (TRP 55). She also testified that
  the Student’s Teacher did not report any concerns with                          at the CSE meeting (TRP 91)
  and said a     is only for
                (TRP 94).
  
  
  Trying to predict                        in a different environment is clearly speculative at best, but I find
  that, given the information and resources available to them, the CSE did not have reason to suspect that an

  courts have held that parental placements are “subject to fewer constraints than that
  
  applied to the school authorities.” S chreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 F. Supp
  
  529 [S.D.N.Y. 2010] The Second Circuit has clearly stated:

                every   special   service   necessary   to   maximize    their   child's
  
                potential. They need only demonstrate that the placement
  
                provides educational instruction specially designed to meet the
  
                unique needs of a handicapped child, supported by such services
  
                as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from instruction.”

  Cum berland County Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 80, 84 [3d Cir. 1999] (holding that "the test for
  
  the parents' private placement is that it is appropriate, and not that it is perfect").
  
  
  
  Parents need only demonstrate that the placement provides educational instruction
  
  specially designed to meet the unique needs of a handicapped child. Frank G. v. Bd. of
  
  Educ., 459 F.3d 356, 364 [2d Cir. 2006]. Parents learn about the unique needs of a
  
  handicapped child through first-hand knowledge, but parents may also rely on the

  The Consultant Teacher spoke of the Student’s need in her placement for
  
                    , the importance of                        in her program, and the need
  
  for                (TRP 399-400). She also stated her concerns that the Student could

  education needs and academic areas, related services, and                      (TRP 233).

  After reviewing the Student’s needs in relation to the information provided about the
  
  Private School, as well as the Student’s progress, I find that the Parent has sustained her
  
  burden of proof in relation to the appropriateness of her placement of the Student.
  
  
  
  Prong III
  
  A board of education may be required to reimburse parents for their expenditures for
  
  private educational services obtained for a student by his or her parents where equitable
  
  considerations support the parents' claim (Florence County Sch.Dist. Four v. Carter, 510
  
  U.S. 7 [1993]; Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 [1985];
  
  R.E., 694 F.3d at 184-85; T.P., 554 F.3d at 252). In Burlington, the Court found that
  
  Congress intended retroactive reimbursement to parents by school officials as an available
  
  remedy in a proper case under the IDEA (471 U.S. at 370-71; see Gagliardo, 489 F.3d at
  
  111; Cerra, 427 F.3d at 192). "Reimbursement merely requires [a district] to belatedly
  
  pay expenses that it should have paid all along and would have borne in the first instance"
  
  had it offered the student a FAPE (Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370-71; see 20 U.S.C. §

  placement has the burden of proof regarding the appropriateness of such placement
  
  (Educ. Law § 4404[1][c]; see R.E., 694 F.3d at 184-85; M .P.G. v. New Y ork City D ep't of
  
  Educ., 2010 WL 3398256, at 7 [S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2010]).
  
  
  
  Tuition reimbursement may be reduced or denied if parents do not provide notice of the
  
  unilateral placement either at the most recent CSE meeting prior to removing the child
  
  from public school, or by written notice ten business days before such removal, "that they
  
  were rejecting the placement proposed by the public agency to provide a [FAPE] to their
  
  child, including stating their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private
  
  school at public expense." (20 U.S.C. § 612[a][10][C][iii][I] ; see 34 C.F.R. § 300.148[d])
  
  This statutory provision "serves the important purpose of giving the school system an
  
  opportunity, before the child is removed, to assemble a team, evaluate the child, devise an
  
  appropriate plan, and determine whether a [FAPE] can be provided in the public schools."

  Procedural History
  
  Our narrative in Prong I left off at the CSE meeting. Here it resumes after the CSE
  
  meeting when the Parent’s Attorney wrote to the CSE Chair in a letter dated August 4,
  
  2015 (Ex. E), reminding the Chair of the concerns the Parent raised during the CSE
  
  meeting, and enclosed a copy of the Student’s June 2015 progress report. She requested
  
  an                , copies of the Student’s 2015                                        and
  
                                  in her native language. In the letter, she stated the Parent
  
  visited the proposed placement but found it inappropriate for the Student because of
  
  
  
                                                   . She informed the CSE that if the District
  
  did not provide a timely and appropriate public school placement, the Student would
  
  attend the Private School and the Parent would seek tuition funding and             (Ex. E,
  
  pp. 3-5). The Parent’s Attorney wrote another letter to the CSE Chair, dated August 14,
  
  2015 (Ex. D) stating that she had not received a response to her previous letter, an
  
  authorization for an                , or copies of the Student’s assessments. She notified

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  the Chair that unless given an appropriate placement, the Parent would enroll the Student
  
  in the Private School and seek tuition funding and            , and enclosed a copy of the
  
  Student’s final progress report (Ex. D).
  
  
  
  In the letter from the CSE Chair to the Parent (Ex. C), dated August 20, 2015, he wrote
  
  that she had a right to request a reconvene of the CSE and asked her to provide the CSE
  
  with updated material, so the CSE could review the materials and determine if a review
  
  was needed. He wrote the Student’s         services were terminated based on an        annual
  
  review plan, dated November 22, 2011, but added that the CSE would consider the
  
  Parent’s letter as a request for reevaluation (Ex. C).
  
  
  
  In the letter from the Parent’s Attorney to the CSE Chair (Ex. B), dated August 25, 2015,
  
  she informed him that the Parent wanted the CSE to reconvene as soon as possible, and
  
  restated her position about unilaterally placing the Student unless offered a suitable public
  
  school placement (Ex. B).
  
  
  
  I credit the Parent for being active in communicating with the CSE and find that equities
  
  here favor the Parent.
  
  
  
  The Request for the Independent
  
  The applicable federal regulation provides in material part as follows: (1) A parent has the
  
  right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees
  
  with an evaluation obtained by the public agency. (2) If a parent requests an independent
  
  educational evaluation at public expense, the public agency must, without unnecessary
  
  delay, either (i) Initiate a hearing under Sec. 300.507 to show that its evaluation is
  
  appropriate; or (ii) Ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided at
  
  public expense, unless the agency demonstrates in a hearing under Sec. 300.507 that the
  
  evaluation obtained by the parent did not meet agency criteria. (3) If the public agency
  
  initiates a hearing and the final decision is that the agency’s evaluation is appropriate, the
  
  parent still has the right to an independent education evaluation, but not at public expense.

   Case No. 159947
  
  
  
  (4) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation, the public agency may ask
  
  for the parent’s reason why he or she objects to the public evaluation. However, the
  
  explanation by the parent may not be required and the public agency may not
  
  unreasonably delay either providing the independent educational evaluation at public
  
  expense or initiating a due process hearing to defend the public evaluation. (34 C.F.R. §
  
  300.502[b]; see also 8 NYCRR 200.5[g])
  
  
  
  In the face of the Parent’s demand, the District has stood silent. The District has neither
  
  issued payment for the requested evaluation, nor did it initiate a hearing under Sec.
  
  300.507 to show that its own evaluation was appropriate. Given the foregoing, I find
  
  entirely for the Parent.
  
  It is therefore ORDERED
  
     -   The District shall provide funding for an independent
  
                      by a provider of the Parent’s choosing provided that the invoice is
  
         submitted within 90 days of this order.
  
     -   The District shall provide funding to Private School for the 2015/16 school
  
         year.
  
  So Ordered,
  
  Dated: May 16, 2016
