  INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
  
             This case exemplifies much of what is wrong, and much of what is right, with
  
  IDEA.                 is a                             student with              (T: 430-431).      She has a
  
  number of                                , but presents with
  
                               , including
  
                               .   Over a period of many years, the parents and the Department of
  
  Education       (“DOE”),         while largely in agreement as to the                child’s   strengths and
  
  weaknesses, have had an ongoing disagreement as to how her needs should appropriately
  
  be met. Throughout that time-period, the parents have consistently sought to have                             ’s
  needs met in a less restrictive environment than has been recommended by the DOE.
  
             The matter before me began in the 2012-2013 school year, although this dispute
  
  had been ongoing since at least the 2008-2009 school year. Three different due process
  
  complaints (PE-A; PE-RR and PE-SS) have advanced issues that appear to be similar in
  
  their theme     – how to support              in an educational environment that is far less restrictive
  
  than recommended by the             DOE’s CSE.       The school years at issue include the 2012-2013,
  
  2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years. An almost unimaginable amount of
  
  energy has been expended by the parents and their capable counsel in advocating for a
  
  highly supported placement in a setting far less restrictive than recommended by the
                    1
  DOE’s      CSE.        At least three different hearing officers have been assigned to decide this
  
  matter, with at least two of them recusing themselves for various reasons after becoming
  
  actively engaged in the case, and many others recusing themselves after less involvement.
  
  Throughout that time period,                      has, by virtue of various pendency orders, been
  
  educated in an environment that is far closer to that desired by the parents than had been
  
  recommended by the DOE. She has reportedly made gains, although perhaps not as many
  
  gains as may have been desired by her parents.

      There have been numerous references during the course of the instant hearing to a pending class action
  lawsuit involving            While I have no doubt as to the potential importance of this litigation in resolving
  issues that clearly need resolution in connection with the provision of appropriate special education
  programs and services to the educationally disabled students residing in New York City, I have not
  considered this pending litigation for any purpose in deciding the much more limited matters before me.

    Case No. 145198
  
  
  
            The issues identified in the three due process complaints are hereby decided as set
  
  forth herein.
  
  THE HEARING EVIDENCE
  
            The hearing in this matter took place over 6 days, with many additional phone
  
  conferences being held in between.       Hundreds of pages of exhibits were offered and
  
  admitted into evidence.      It is undisputed that the recommendations made by the CSE
  
  during the time-period covered by the three due process complaints failed to offer         a
  
  FAPE during that time period. The DOE acknowledged as much. Yet, notwithstanding
  
  this rather clear admission, the issue of what to do about it is not nearly as clear.     As
  
  indicated above, the DOE has provided           with a significant amount of support during
  
  the time-period covered by the issues before me.       This support was the result of hard-
  
  fought legal battles waged by and on behalf of the parents and student and cannot be
  
  ignored in fashioning a remedy for the acknowledged denial of FAPE during the years at
  
  issue. I find that the hearing issues before me are really quite narrow. Specifically, can
  
  this   child’s needs be appropriately met in an educational   environment like that which has
  
  and is sought by the parents? If so, what, if any, additional steps can be taken, whether in
  
  the form of compensatory education services or otherwise, to further the goal of
  
  receiving appropriate educational services in that least restrictive environment?        My
  
  decision, and the remedy set forth herein, is focused upon these questions.
  
  THE LEGAL STANDARDS
  
            Pursuant to the IDEA, all children with disabilities are entitled to a “free
  appropriate public education” (“FAPE”) which must include “special education and
  related services” tailored to meet the unique needs of the child and be “reasonably
  calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.”   B oard of Education of the
  
  Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 207 (1982); (20
  
  U.S.C. § 1400[d][1][A]; Schaffer v. W east, 126 S. Ct. 528, 531 [2005]; Frank G. v. B oard
  
  of Education, 459 F.3d 356, 371 [2nd Cir. 2006]). A FAPE is offered to a student when
  
  (a) the board of education complies with the procedural requirements set forth in the
  
  IDEA, and (b) the IEP developed by its CSE through the IDEA’s procedures is reasonably

   Case No. 145198
  
  
  
  calculated to enable the student to receive educational benefits (Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-
  
  07; Cerra v. Paw ling Central School District, 427 F.3d 186, 192 [2nd Cir. 2005]). The
  
  Second Circuit Court of Appeals in W alczak v. Florida Union Free School District, 142
  
  F.3d 119 (2nd Cir. 1998) held that the IDEA does not articulate any specific level of
  
  educational benefits that must be provided through an IEP.        The Court citing to the
  
  Supreme Court ruling in Rowley reiterated that the IDEA does not require the states to
  
  maximize the potential of disabled children, but was meant “more to open the door of
  public education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to guarantee any
  
  particular level of education once inside” (at pg. 192). The Second Circuit in    W alczak
  
  also cites to a D.C. Circuit Court decision by now Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
  
  Ginsburg which held that because “public resources are not infinite,” federal law “does
  not secure the best education money can buy; it calls upon government, more modestly, to
  
  provide an appropriate education for each [disabled] child” (Lunceford       v. District of
  
  Columbia Bd. of Educ., 745 F.2d 1577, 1583 [D.C. Cir. 1984]). The Third Circuit has
  
  held that an appropriate education under the IDEA is one that is “likely to produce
  progress, not regression” (Cy press-Fairbank s   Indep. Sch. Dist. V . Michael F., 118 F.3d
  
  245, 248 [3rd Cir. 1997]; cert denied 522 U.S. 1047 [1998]; Cerra, 427 F.3d at 195,
  
  quoting W alczak, 142 F.3d at 130 [citations omitted]; see Perricelli v. Carm el Central
  
  School District,   2007 WL 465211, at *15).         The statute ensures an “appropriate”
  education, “not one that provides everything that might be thought     desirable by loving
  
  parents” (W alczak,   142 F.3d at 132, quoting Tucker v. Bay Shore Union Free School
  
  District, 873 F.2d 563, 567 [2nd Cir. 1989][citations omitted]; see Grim , 346 F.3d at
  
  379). The IEP must be “reasonably calculated to provide some ‘meaningful’ benefit”
  (Mrs. B. v. Milford B oard of Education, 103 F.3d 1114, 1120 [2nd Cir. 1997]; see
  
  Rowley, 458 U.S. at 192). Objective factors such as the attainment of passing grades and
  
  regular advancement from grade to grade are generally accepted indicators of satisfactory
  
  progress and one important factor in determining educational benefit (Rowley, 458 U.S. at
  
  207, n.28, 203-04; W alczak, 142 F.3d at 130; V iola v. A rlington Central School District,
  
  414 F. Supp. 2d 366, 382 [S.D.N.Y. 2006]).

   Case No. 145198
  
  
  
         The student’s recommended program           must also be provided in the least restrictive
  
  environment (LRE) (20 U.S.C. § 1412[a][5][A]; 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.114[a][2][i],
  
  300.116[a][2]; 8 NYCRR 200.6[a][1]; see W alczak, 142 F.3d at 132).                 The LRE is
  
  defined as “one that, to the greatest        extent possible, satisfactorily educates disabled
  
  children together with children who are not disabled, in the same school the disabled
  
  child would attend if the child were not disabled” (Carlisle      A rea Sch. V . Scott P., 62 F.3d
  
  520, 535 [3rd Cir. 1995]).       The IDEA mandates that all students with disabilities may
  
  only be removed to a more restrictive environment when the nature and severity of the
  
  disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and
  
  services    cannot     be   achieved   satisfactorily   (20   U.S.C.   1412[a][5][A];   34   CFR
  
  300.550[a][2]; Oberti v. Bd. of Educ., 995 F.2d 1204, 1213 [3rd Cir. 1993]; Briggs v. Bd.
  
  of Educ., 882 F.2d 688, 691 [2nd Cir. 1989]; Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ., 874 F.2d
  
  1036, 1044 [5th Cir. 1989]).
  
         “The fact that a student with a disability might make greater academic progress in
         a special education class may not warrant excluding the student from a regular
         education program (Oberti v. Borough of Clementon Sch. Dist., 995 F.2d 1204
              rd
         [3        Cir. 1993]). The CSE must also consider the unique benefits, academic and
         otherwise, which a student may receive by remaining in regular classes such as
         language and role modeling with nondisabled peers” (Greer              v. Rome City Sch.
         Dist., 950 F.2d 688 [11th Cir. 1991]).
  
  
         The Second Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the Oberti LRE test in P. v.
  
  Newington B oard of Educ., 546 F.3d 111 (2 nd Cir. 2008) requiring the consideration of
  
  whether the school has made reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in a regular
  
  classroom, the educational benefits to the child with appropriate supplementary aids and
  
  services versus a special class and the possible negative effects of the inclusion of the
  
  child on the education of the other students in the class.
  
         Federal district     courts have upheld the appropriateness of an IEP “given what the
  CSE knew about [the child] at the time it was developing the … IEP”             E.S . v. K atonah-
  
  Lewisboro School District, 742 F.Supp.2d 417 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).               In J.R . v. B oard of
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                         7
  
  
   Case No. 145198
  
  
  
  Education of the City of Rye School D istrict, 345 F.Supp.2d 386 (S.D.N.Y. 2004), the
  
  Court held that in reviewing the appropriateness of an IEP that:
  
                 “This determination is necessarily prospective in nature; we therefore must
         not engage in Monday-morning    quarterbacking guided by our knowledge of S.R.’s
         subsequent progress at Eagle Hill, but rather consider the propriety of the IEP with
         respect to the likelihood that it would benefit S.R. at the time it was devised. See
         A ntonaccio,   281 F.Supp.2d at 724 (noting that this issue has not yet been
         addressed by the Second Circuit and holding that ‘the …IEP…must be evaluated
         at the time the CSE devised the IEP, on June 15, 1999, and the IHO and SRO
         erred by regarding any information about [the student’s] education        after that
         date’).”
  
  The SRO has consistently considered the IEP “at the time it was formulated” to determine
  if it was reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive educational benefit
  
  (A pplication of a Student with a Disability, SRO Appeal Nos. 11-154, 09-034, 09-013).
  
         In terms of the available remedies in cases where a district has failed to meet its
  
  obligation to offer an educationally disabled child FAPE, IHO’s have substantial
  discretion. Since P. ex rel. M r. and Mrs. P. v. Newington Bd. of Educ., 546 F.3d 111, 122
  
  (2d Cir.2008), the courts of the Second Circuit have ceased to limit eligibility for
  
  “compensatory education” to those over 21. In P, the Second Circuit ruled that
  “compensatory education” can be awarded to an elementary school student. Further, even
  the “gross violation” requirement, which is applicable to a claim for compensatory
  education by someone over 21 is not clearly established in this Circuit to be applicable to
  
  a student under 21. That standard was not relied upon in P.
  
         In S.A . ex rel. M .A .K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 12-CV-435 (RMM)
  
  (MDG), 2014 WL 1311761 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2014), the Court held:
  
             The IDEA allows a hearing officer to fashion an “appropriate remedy, and ...
             compensatory education is an available option ... to make up for denial of a
             [FAPE].” P. ex   rel. Mr. and Mrs. P. v. Newington Bd. of Educ., 546 F.3d 111,
             122 (2d Cir.2008) (affirming compensatory education award for elementary
             school student); see also Student X v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., No. 07
             CV 2316, 2008 WL 4890440, at *24 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2008) (awarding
             compensatory education to student younger than twenty-one). Such an award
             serves “to compensate a student who was actually educated under an
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                              8

             inadequate IEP” and “to catch-up the student to where he should have been
             absent the denial of a FAPE.” B rennan v. Regional Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of
             Educ.,    531    F.Supp.2d       245,   265    (D.Conn.2008).    Before     awarding
             compensatory education for a student older than twenty-one, a court must find
             a gross violation of the student's right to a FAPE; however, whether the same
             prerequisite exists to awarding compensatory education for a younger student
             is an open question. See Student X, 2008 WL 4980440, at *24. P. v.
             Newington, 512 F.Supp.2d 89, 112 n. 3 (D. Conn.2007)          (“The Court disagrees
             with the defendant's argument that compensatory education is warranted only
             if there is a ‘gross' violation of the IDEA. The requirement of a gross violation
             ... has been applied only to cases involving claimants over the a ge    of 21.”),
             aff'd, 546 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2008); but see J.A . v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist.,
             603 F.Supp.2d 684, 690 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (finding that five-year-old student
             was not entitled to compensatory speech therapy, reasoning that parents failed
             to show gross  violation because child “was not excluded from school for any
             period of time.”).
  
         Also, Reid ex rel. Reid v. D.C., 401 F.3d 516, 522-26 (D.C. Cir. 2005) seems to
  
  stand for the proposition that “compensatory education” can be prospective educational
  services to compensate for a past deficient program and that a hearing officer, as well as a
  
  court, can fashion flexible “compensatory education” relief through the application of
  “equitable considerations.” Reid is cited by, for example, the Second        Circuit in P., 546
  
  F.3d at 123, for the proposition that “[t]he IDEA allows a hearing officer to fashion an
  appropriate remedy, and we have held compensatory education is an available option
  
  under the Act to make up for denial of a free and appropriate public     education.”
         It is well-settled that   the dispute between the parties must at all stages be “real and
  live” and not “academic” or it risks becoming moot (see Lillbask v. State ofConn. Dep’t
  of Educ., 397 F.3d 77, 84 [2d Cir. 2005]; Patsk in v. Bd. of Educ., 583 F. Supp. 2d 422,

  with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal
  
  No. 07-085; A pplication of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 07-077). In general,
  
  cases dealing with issues such as desired changes in IEPs, specific placements, and
  
  implementation disputes may become moot at the end of the school year because no
  
  meaningful relief can be granted (see, e.g., A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No.
  
  06-044; A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No. 05-058; A pplication of a Child with
  
  a Disability , Appeal No. 04-027; A pplication of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 00-
  
  037; A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No. 00-016; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Disability, Appeal No. 96-37). Administrative decisions rendered in cases concerning
  
  such issues arising out of school years that have since expired may no longer
  
  appropriately address the current needs of the student (see Daniel R.R. v. El Paso Indep.
  
  Sch. Dist., 874 F.2d 1036, 1040 [5th Cir. 1989]; M.S. v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ.,
  
  2010 WL 3377667, at *9 [E.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2010]; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Disability , Appeal No. 07-139; A pplication of the Bd. of Educ., Appeal No. 07-028;
  
  A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 06-070; A pplication of a Child with
  
  a Disability , Appeal No. 04-007).
  
         An exception to the above rule relating the mootness of claims such as this
  
  provides that a claim may not be moot in such circumstances if the conduct complained
  
  of is 'capable of repetition, yet evading review' (see Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318-23
  
  [1988]; Lillbask, 397 F.3d at 84-85; Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1040; A pplication of a Child
  
  with a Disability , Appeal No. 04-038). The exception applies only in limited situations
  
  (City of Los A ngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 [1983]), and is severely circumscribed
  
  (K naust v. City of Kingston, 157 F.3d 86, 88 [2d Cir. 1998]). First, it must be apparent
  
  that 'the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its
  
  cessation or expiration' (Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 482 [1982]; see K naust, 157
  
  F.3d at 88; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139). Second,
  
  controversies are 'capable of repetition' when there is a reasonable expectation that the
  
  same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again (W einstein v.
  
  B radford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 [1975]; see Hearst Corp., 50 N.Y.2d at 714-15; A pplication

      Case No. 145198
  
  
  
  of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139). To create a reasonable expectation of
  
  recurrence, repetition must be more than theoretically possible (Murphy, 455 U.S. at 482;
  
  Russman v. Bd. of Educ., 260 F.3d 114, 120 [2d Cir. 2001]; A pplication of a Child with a
  
  Disability , Appeal No. 07-139). Mere speculation that the parties will be involved in a
  
  dispute over the same issue does not rise to the level of a reasonable expectation or
  
  demonstrated probability of recurrence (Russman, 260 F.3d at 120; M.S., 2010 WL
  
  3377667, at *9 [noting that each year a new determination is made based on a student's
  
  continuing development]; J.N. v. Depew Union Free School Dist., 2008 WL 4501940, at
  
  *4 [W.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2008]; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-
  
  139). Mootness may be raised at any stage of litigation (In re Kurtzman, 194 F.3d 54, 58
  
  [2d Cir. 1999]; A pplication of a Child with a Disability , Appeal No. 07-139).
  
  FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
              I need not decide whether       ’s needs   can be appropriately met in an         .
  
  The facts of this matter suggest that, with a great deal of effort, she has made progress in
  
  that setting.       However, I find that the specific issues raised in the various due process
  
  complaints have, due to the passage of time, largely been rendered moot. I do not find
  
  that any of the exceptions are applicable. I find that no productive purpose would be
  
  served by individually deciding the specific issues that have been advanced in the three
  
  due process complaints.           Further, I find that no meaningful, specific relief can be
  
  fashioned at this time for alleged shortcomings in the manner in which the DOE offered
  
  FAPE during the past 5 years. I find, however, that, as a general proposition, the      DOE’s
  acknowledged denial of FAPE during this period warrants compensatory services as set
  
  forth herein. I find that the claim set forth in the    DOE’s Closing Brief that there has been
  no denial of FAPE is technically incorrect, although practically plausible. I further find
  
  that the nature and extent of the compensatory services that are appropriate must take into
  
  account the extensive services that the DOE had provided in accordance with the 1st and
      nd
  2        pendency orders. The compensatory services set forth herein are designed to support
  
  this     child’s   educational program going forward in a manner that will hopefully serve to
  
  end, or at least slow, the cycle of litigation that had clearly distracted the parties from

  developing and implementing an educational program that can meaningfully and
  
  appropriately meet this    child’s      significant needs in the least restrictive environment.
  
  They are expressly NOT intended to be supplemental to the services provided as part of
  
  the previously-issued pendency orders.
