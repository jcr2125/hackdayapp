      Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  I. JURISDICTION - OVERVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
  
  
  
           This impartial due process proceeding arises under the Individuals with
  
  Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482, and Article 89 of the New
  
  York State Education Law. This hearing was requested by the advocates for the student
  
  and the parent in a due process complaint notice dated March 25, 2015.                       The primary
  
  issue to be determined at this hearing is whether the Department of Education (the
  
  “DOE”) shall be ordered to reimburse the parent, and/or directly pay for, costs associated
  
  with the student’s unilateral private placement at
  
            for the 2013/14 school year (Ex. P-A).1
  
           When a student in New York is eligible for special education services, the IDEA
  
  calls for the creation of an individualized education program (“IEP”), which is delegated
  
  to a local committee on special education (the “CSE”) that includes, but is not limited to,
  
  parents, teachers, at least one psychologist, and school district representatives. See N.Y.
  
  Educ. Law § 4402; see also 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414(d)(1)(a)-(b); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.320,
  
  300.321; 8 NYCRR §§ 200.3, 200.4(d)(2). If disputes occur between parents and school
  
  districts, incorporated among the procedural protections is the opportunity to engage in
  
  mediation, present state complaints, and initiate an impartial due process hearing. See 20
  
  U.S.C. §§ 1221e-3, 1415(e)-(f); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.151 - 300.152, 300.506, 300.511; N.Y.
  
  Educ. Law § 4404(1); 8 NYCRR §§ 200.5(h)-(l).
  
           New York State has implemented a two-tiered system of administrative review to
  
  address disputed matters between parents and school districts regarding “any matter
  
  relating to the identification, evaluation or educational placement of a student with a
  
  disability, or a student suspected of having a disability, or the provision of a free
  
  appropriate public education to such student.” See 8 NYCRR § 200.5(i)(1); see also 20
  
  U.S.C. §§ 1415(b)(6)-(7); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.503(a)(1)-(2), 300.507(a)(1). An impartial
  
  hearing officer (“IHO”) typically conducts a trial-type hearing regarding the matters in
  
  dispute in which the parties have the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and

      Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  certain other individuals with special knowledge or training; present evidence and
  
  confront, cross-examine and compel the attendance of witnesses; prohibit the
  
  introduction of any evidence at the hearing that has not been disclosed five (5) business
  
  days before the hearing; and obtain a verbatim record of the proceeding. See 20 U.S.C.
  
  §§ 1415(f)(2)(a), (h)(1)-(3); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.521(a)(1)-(4); 8 NYCRR §§ 200.5(j)(3)(v),
  
  (vii), (xii). The IHO must render and transmit a final written decision in the matter to the
  
  parties not later than forty-five (45) days after the expiration period or adjusted period for
  
  the resolution process.       See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.510(b)(2), (c), 300.515(a); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.5(j)(5). A party may seek a specific extension of time of the 45-day timeline, which
  
  the IHO may grant in accordance with state and federal regulations.                    See 34 C.F.R. §
  
  300.515(c); 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(5).              The decision of the IHO is binding upon both
  
  parties unless appealed.        See N.Y. Educ. Law § 4404(1).              A party aggrieved by the
  
  decision of an IHO may appeal that decision to a State Review Officer (“SRO”).                         See
  
  N.Y. Educ. Law § 4402(2); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1415(g)(1); 34 C.F.R. § 300.514(b)(1); 8
  
  NYCRR § 200.5(k).
  
  II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
  
  
  
           The DOE appointed me to hear this matter on March 25, 2015. See 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.5(j)(3)(i).    Hearings in this matter was thereafter held on: December 2, 2015;
  
  February 8, 2016; and June 1, 2016.2 Appended to this decision are: a statement of appeal
  
  rights; a list of the persons in attendance at the hearings; and a list of the documents
  
  received into evidence. See 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(5)(v).
  
  III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
  
  
  
           At the time of the March 25, 2015 due process complaint, the student was
  
  2
   Following my appointment to this case, the parties moved to extend the case compliance date in this matter
  several times in order to accommodate the availability of the parties’ witnesses and in order to allow for
  adequate time for my review of the hearing record taken on the extensive issues raised in the parent’s due
  process complaint. In considering those requests, I weighed the cumulative impact of the relevant factors
  and found that the stated reasons for the extensions justified the delay in the resolution of the matter and
  were in accordance with the requirements of due process. Accordingly, requests for extensions of the case
  compliance date were granted (R. 5-9, 46-47, 105-106; Exs.         IHO-I - IHO-XIX).      See 34 C.F.R. §
  300.515(c); 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(5).
      Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                                      5
  
      Case No. 155154
  
  
  
                     , has been diagnosed with
  
               , and presents with
  
                               (Exs. SD-1 at 2-3, SD-3, SD-5, P-A). For the 2013/14 school year,
  
  the student attended the                        at the
  
  (“                   ”) in               (Exs. P-A, P-E, P-F, P-G, P-G, P-J). The Commissioner
  
  of Education has not approved                              as a nonpublic school with which public
  
  school districts may contract to instruct students with disabilities.              See 8 NYCRR §§
  
  200.1(d), 200.7. The student's current eligibility for special education and related services
  
  as                                                            is not in dispute in this hearing (Exs.
  
  SD-1 at 1, P-A, P-C at 1). See 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(             ); 8 NYCRR § 200.1(zz)(         ).3
  
            The student attended                   at                     , where he was first evaluated
  
  and provided services through                              . The student then attended
  
              for about                 years.    Following that time, the student attended
  
             (Ex. SD-3).
  
            Testing administered on June 1, 2009 suggested
  
                , with                                                .                    , the student’s
  
  scores reflected
  
                               (Ex. SD-2 at 2).
  
            In January 2013, the student’s
  
                                   .   On the abbreviated form of the
  
                               , he obtained a                                                      . The
  
  student was also administered the                                                                .     The
  
  student                                were found to be within                       (
  
                                                           ) (Ex. SD-2 at 2-3).
  
            At a meeting held on April 10, 2013, the CSE recommended that student receive
  
  the majority of his instruction in a                            in a community school on a
  
            basis.   The CSE also recommended that the student receive related services of:

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  
                                      (Ex. SD-1 at 8-9, 12-13).
  
            On April 22, 2013, the parent signed an enrollment contract for the student’s
  
  attendance at                  for the 2013/14 school year (Ex. P-H).
  
            In a final notice of recommendation (“FNR”) dated May 30, 2013, the DOE
  
  advised the parent that the student’s recommended program would be implemented at
  
        in            .   In June 2013, the parent return the FNR to the DOE with a note
  
  stating that, after observing the proposed program, she did not believe it constituted an
  
  appropriate placement for him because                                   “
  
                                                                      ” (Ex. P-D).
  
            In a letter dated August 12, 2013, the parent advised the CSE that she was
  
  rejecting its proposed program for the student and would unilaterally place him at
  
            for the 2013/14 school year at public expense (Ex. P-E). This hearing ensued.
  
  IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
  
            A. The DOE
  
            The parent’s claim for tuition reimbursement and/or direct payment for the
  
  student’s unilateral placement at                   for the 2013/14 school year should be
  
  denied.    The DOE offered the student a free appropriate public education in the least
  
  restrictive environment for the 2013/14 school year.       The CSE which developed the
  
  student’s IEP was duly constituted. The CSE relied on sufficient and adequate evaluative
  
  information to develop its IEP for the student. The parent was permitted to meaningfully
  
  participate in the CSE meeting. The IEP goals and objectives were reasonably related to
  
  the student’s educational needs.    The proposed program was reasonably calculated to
  
  confer meaningful educational benefit to the student.                              was an
  
  inappropriate and overly restrictive placement for the student which failed to meet his
  
  special education needs.    The relevant equities also do not support the parent’s tuition
  
  reimbursement/direct payment claim.
  
            B. The Parent
  
            The DOE should be ordered to reimburse the parent, and/or directly pay, for the
       Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                                    7
  
       Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  student’s unilateral placement at                             for the 2013/14 school year. The DOE
  
  failed to develop an appropriate educational program for the student.                 The CSE which
  
  developed the student’s IEP was not duly constituted.                The CSE relied on insufficient
  
  evaluative information when it developed its IEP for the student.                 The parent was not
  
  permitted to meaningfully participate in the CSE meeting. The IEP goals and objectives
  
  were not reasonably related to the student’s educational needs. The                         and
  
           of the proposed program was not appropriate. The other students in the proposed
  
  program did not have similar                                                 needs.
  
  appropriately addressed the student’s unique educational needs.                 The relevant equities
  
  also support an award of tuition reimbursement, and/or direct public funding, of the
  
  student’s tuition to                        (Ex. P-A).
  
  V. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
             A. Applicable Legal Standards
  
             Two purposes of the IDEA, see 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482, are: (a) to ensure that
  
             students with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public
  
             education (“FAPE”) that emphasizes special education and related services
  
             designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,
  
             employment, and independent living; and (b) to ensure that the rights of students
  
             with disabilities and parents of such students are protected, see 20 U.S.C. §
  
             1400(d)(1)(A)-(B); see generally Forest Grove v. T.A ., 557 U.S. 230, 239 (2009);
  
             B oard of Educ. of the Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176,
  
             206-07 (1982).4
  
             A FAPE is offered to a student when: (a) the board of education complies with the
  
  procedural requirements set forth in the IDEA; and (b) the IEP developed by its CSE
  
  
  4
      The term “free appropriate public education” means special education and related services that –
              (A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without
  charge;
             (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency;
             (C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the
             State involved; and
             (D) are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section
             1414(d) of this title. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9); 34 C.F.R. § 300.17.

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  through the IDEA's procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive
  
  educational benefits. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07; H.C. v. K atonah-Lew isboro Union
  
  Free Sch. Dist., 2013 WL 3155869 (2d Cir. June 24, 2013); R.E. v. New Y ork City D ep't.

  10, 2013); M.H. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 685 F.3d 217, 245 (2d Cir. 2012);
  
  Cerra v. Paw ling Cent. Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 186, 192 (2d Cir. 2005).       "'[A]dequate
  
  compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of
  
  what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP.'" W alczak v. Florida
  
  Union Free Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at
  
  206); see T.P. v. M amaroneck Union Free Sch. Dist., 554 F.3d 247, 253 (2d Cir. 2009).
  
  While the Second Circuit has emphasized that school districts must comply with the
  
  checklist of procedures for developing a student's IEP and has indicated that "[m]ultiple
  
  procedural violations may cumulatively result in the denial of a FAPE even if the
  
  violations considered individually do not," see R.E., 694 F.3d at 190-91, the Court has
  
  also explained that not all procedural errors render an IEP legally inadequate under the
  
  IDEA, M.H., 685 F.3d at 245; A .C. v. Bd. of Educ., 553 F.3d 165, 172 (2d Cir. 2009);

  Carm el Cent. Sch. Dist., 2007 WL 465211, at *10
  
  (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2007).    Under the IDEA, if procedural violations are alleged, an
  
  administrative officer may find that a student did not receive a FAPE only if the
  
  procedural inadequacies: (a) impeded the student's right to a FAPE; (b) significantly
  
  impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding
  
  the provision of a FAPE to the student; or (c) caused a deprivation of educational
  
  benefits.   See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii); 34 C.F.R. § 300.513(a)(2); 8 NYCRR §

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
            The IDEA directs that, in general, an IHO's decision must be made on substantive
  
  grounds based on a determination of whether the student received a FAPE. See 20 U.S.C.
  
  § 1415(f)(3)(E)(i). A school district offers a FAPE "by providing personalized instruction
  
  with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that
  
  instruction." See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203. However, the "IDEA does not itself articulate
  
  any specific level of educational benefits that must be provided through an IEP."
  
  W alczak, 142 F.3d at 130; see Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189.           The statute ensures an
  
  "appropriate" education, "not one that provides everything that might be thought desirable
  
  by loving parents." See W alczak, 142 F.3d at 132 (quoting Tucker v. Bay Shore Union
  
  Free Sch. Dist., 873 F.2d 563, 567 (2d Cir. 1989); see also Grim, 346 F.3d at 379.
  
  Additionally, school districts are not required to "maximize" the potential of students with
  
  disabilities. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189, 199; Grim, 346 F.3d at 379; W alczak, 142 F.3d
  
  at 132.    Nonetheless, a school district must provide "an IEP that is 'likely to produce
  
  progress, not regression,' and . . . affords the student with an opportunity greater than
  
  mere 'trivial advancement.'" See Cerra, 427 F.3d at 195 (quoting W alczak, 142 F.3d at
  
  130); see also T.P., 554 F.3d at 254; P. v. Newington Bd. of Educ., 546 F.3d 111, 118-19
  
  (2d Cir. 2008); Perricelli, 2007 WL 465211, at *15.        The IEP must be "reasonably
  
  calculated to provide some 'meaningful' benefit" See M rs. B. v. Milford Bd. of Educ., 103
  
  F.3d 1114, 1120 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Rowley, 458 U.S. at 192.            The student's
  
  recommended program must also be provided in the least restrictive environment
  
  (“LRE”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.114(a)(2)(i), 300.116(a)(2); 8

            An appropriate educational program begins with an IEP that includes a statement
  
  of the student's present levels of academic achievement and functional performance, see

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  WL 2736027, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 3, 2008), establishes annual goals designed to meet
  
  the student's needs resulting from the student's disability and enable him or her to make
  
  progress in the general education curriculum, see 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.320(a)(2)(i), (2)(i)(A);
  
  8 NYCRR § 200.4(d)(2)(iii), and provides for the use of appropriate special education
  
  services, see 34 C.F.R. § 300.320(a)(4); 8 NYCRR § 200.4(d)(2)(v).
  
         A board of education may be required to reimburse parents for their expenditures
  
  for private educational services obtained for a student by his or her parents, if the services
  
  offered by the board of education were inadequate or inappropriate, the services selected
  
  by the parents were appropriate, and equitable considerations support the parents' claim.
  
  See Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993); School Comm. of
  
  Burlington v. Dep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).           The remedy of tuition
  
  reimbursement has been extended to authorize direct payments to a private school for
  
  educational services rendered where B urlington/Carter factors are satisfied.      M r. A . v.

         The burden of proof is on the school district during an impartial hearing, except
  
  that a parent seeking tuition reimbursement for a unilateral placement has the burden of
  
  proof regarding the appropriateness of such placement.            See N.Y. Educ. Law §
  
  4404(1)(c); see also R.E., 694 F.3d at 184-85; M.P.G. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ.,

         B. Proposed Public Program - Procedural
  
         Turning to the first prong of the B urlington/Carter test, I must determine whether
  
  the DOE complied with the procedural protections of the IDEA. See Cerra, 427 F.3d at
  
  192.
  
                 1. CSE Composition
  
         The parent alleges that the April 10, 2013 CSE was not properly constituted (Ex. P-
  
  A at 2). An IEP must be prepared by a CSE having each of its required members. See,
  
  e.g., A pplication of a Child with a Disability (Byram Hills Cent. Sch. Dist.), Appeal No.
  
  99-54 (SRO July 31, 2000). A CSE must consist of: the parents of the student; at least

    Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  one regular education teacher of the student (if the child is, or may be, participating in the
  
  regular education environment); at least one special education teacher of the student, or if
  
  appropriate, at least one special education provider of the child; a school psychologist; a
  
  representative of the school district qualified to provide or supervise the provision of
  
  special education; and an individual who can interpret the evaluations being reviewed by
  
  the CSE. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414(b)(4)(A), (d)(1)(B); 34 C.F.R. § 300.321; N.Y. Educ.
  
  Law §§ 4402(1)(b), 4410(3), 8 NYCRR § 200.3(a).
  
         The evidence contained in the hearing record reflects the April 10, 2013 CSE
  
  meeting was duly constituted. In attendance at the April 10, 2013 CSE meeting was the
  
  student’s special education teacher from                     , a general education teacher
  
  (who also served as the district representative of the meeting), the parent, a school
  
  psychologist, a parent advocate, and a                        (R. 58, 68; Ex. SD-1 at 15).
  
         Alternatively, to the extent that the parent objected to Mr.                serving as
  
  the general education teacher at the April 10, 2013 meeting, I find that his participation in
  
  the meeting did not result in or contribute to a denial of FAPE. The IDEA requires that a
  
  CSE include not less than one regular education teacher of the student, if the student is or
  
  may be participating in the general education environment.               See 20 U.S.C. §
  
  1414(d)(1)(B)(ii); 34 C.F.R. § 300.321(a)(2); N.Y. Educ. Law § 4402(1)(b)(1)(a)(ii); 8
  
  NYCRR § 200.3(a)(1)(ii); E.A .M. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2012 W.L. 4571794,
  
  at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2012). The April 2013 CSE did not contain a regular education
  
  teacher who provided instruction to the student during the 2012/13 school year; however,
  
  it did include a regular education teacher, i.e., Mr.             (Ex. SD-1 at 15).     Even
  
  assuming, arguendo, that this was a procedural violation, it did not rise to the level of a
  
  denial of FAPE in this instance, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii); 34 C.F.R. §
  
  300.513(a)(2); 8 NYCRR § 200.5(j)(4)(ii), as the student was not recommended to
  
  participate in                                during the 2013/14 school year (Ex. SD-1 at
  
  8).
  
                         2. Adequacy of Evaluations
  
         The parent alleges that the CSE failed to administer the necessary evaluations to
  
  form the basis for the development of an appropriate IEP (Ex. P-A at 2).
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                         12
  
    Case No. 155154
  
  
  
             A school district must conduct an evaluation of a student where the educational or
  
  related services needs of a student warrant a reevaluation or if the student's parent or
  
  teacher requests a reevaluation, see 34 C.F.R. § 300.303(a)(2); 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(4);
  
  however, a district need not conduct a reevaluation more frequently than once per year
  
  unless the parent and the district otherwise agree and at least once every three years
  
  unless the district and the parent agree in writing that such a reevaluation is unnecessary,
  
  see 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.303(b)(1)-(2); 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(4).           A CSE may direct that
  
  additional evaluations or assessments be conducted in order to appropriately assess the
  
  student in all areas related to the suspected disabilities. See 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(3).
  
  Any evaluation of a student with a disability must use a variety of assessment tools and
  
  strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information about
  
  the student, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining,
  
  among other things the content of the student's IEP. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(2)(A); 34
  
  C.F.R. § 300.304(b)(1)(ii); Letter to Clark e, 48 IDELR 77 (OSEP 2007). In particular, a
  
  school district must rely on technically sound instruments that may assess the relative
  
  contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental
  
  factors.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(2)(C); 34 C.F.R. § 300.304(b)(3); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.4(b)(6)(x). A district must ensure that a student is appropriately assessed in all areas
  
  related to the suspected disability, including, where appropriate, social and emotional
  
  status.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(3)(B); 34 C.F.R. § 300.304(c)(4); 8 NYCRR §
  
  200.4(b)(6)(vii).     An evaluation of a student must be sufficiently comprehensive to
  
  identify all of the student's special education and related services needs, whether or not
  
  commonly linked to the disability category in which the student has been classified. See
  
  34 C.F.R. § 300.304(c)(6); 8 NYCRR § 200.4(b)(6)(ix).
  
             I find that the CSE had adequate evaluative information of the student’s
  
             functional,developmental and academic needs upon which to premise its program
  
             for the student for the 2013/14 school year (R. 59; Ex. SD-1 at 1-3). At the April
  
             10, 2013 meeting, the CSE considered: a January 2013 progress report prepared
  
             by the student’s                      teacher; a January 12, 2013
  
             progress report; a January 15, 2013                     evaluation; a January 15,

           2013                           ; a February 22, 2013                             progress
  
           report; and an April 8, 2013                  progress report (R. 59; Exs. SD-1, SD-2,
  
           SD-3, SD-4, SD-5, SD-6, SD-7).          Ms.                      , the student’s
  
                       teacher at                   , was also present at the April 2013 CSE
  
           meeting, participated in the meeting’s discussion and gave input regarding the
  
           student’s                             (R. 58-59; Ex. SD-1 at 15).
  
                    3. Adequacy of IEP Goals
  
           The parent alleges that the              goals included in the student’s IEP failed to
  
  meet his unique educational needs (Ex. P-A at 2).              An IEP must include a written
  
  statement of measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals designed
  
  to meet the student’s needs that result from the student’s disability to enable the student to
  
  be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum, and meet each of
  
  the student’s other educational needs that result from the student’s disability.            See 20
  
  U.S.C.    §     1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II);   34   C.F.R.     §   300.320(a)(2)(i);    8   NYCRR     §§
  
  200.4(d)(2)(iii), 200.16(3)(3).     Each annual goal shall include the evaluative criteria,
  
  evaluation procedures and schedules to be used to measure progress toward meeting the
  
  annual goal during the period beginning with placement and ending with the next
  
  scheduled review by the committee.           See 8 NYCRR § 200.4(d)(2)(iii)(b); see also 20
  
  U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(III); 34 C.F.R. § 300.320(a)(3).
  
           I find that the CSE’s IEP for the student for the 2013/14 school year established
  
  annual educational goals which were reasonably related to his educational deficits. The
  
  April 10, 2013 IEP included annual goals in:
  
  
  
                                                                                         which were
  
  consistent with those educational deficits identified in the IEP and described what he
  
  could reasonably be expected to accomplish within a                             period. The annual
  
  goals also included the evaluative criteria, evaluation procedures and schedules to be used
  
  to measure the student’s progress toward meeting each annual goal (R. 62-63; Ex. SD-1 at
  
  4-7). See 8 NYCRR § 200.4(d)(2)(iii)(b); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(III); 34
  
  C.F.R. § 300.320(a)(3).

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
         C. Proposed Public Program - Substantive
  
         As noted earlier, the IDEA directs that, in general, an impartial hearing officer’s
  
  decision must be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the
  
  student received a FAPE. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E)(I). A school district offers a
  
  FAPE “by providing personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit
  
  the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.” See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203.
  
  The IEP must be “reasonably calculated to provide some ‘meaningful’ benefit.” M rs. B.
  
  v. Milford Bd. of Educ., 103 F.3d 1114, 1120 (2d Cir. 1997), quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at
  
  192.
  
         Based on the evidence submitted into the hearing record, I find that the CSE’s
  
  proposed program was reasonably calculated to provide the student with meaningful
  
  educational benefit.   According to the student’s                        teacher at
  
          , the student was                                                              in the
  
  spring of 2013 (R. 79; Exs. SD-1 at 1-2; SD-4). For the 2013/14 school year, the CSE
  
  recommended that student receive                                                            in
  
  a community school on a                      basis.   The CSE also recommended that the
  
  student receive related services of:
  
  
  
  
                                                                                               .
  
                                                                                          were
  
  also included in the student’s IEP (R. 60; Ex. SD-1 at 8-10, 12-13).            The CSE ’s
  
  recommended program mirrored his                              program at                     ,
  
  although there were only               enrolled students in the private program during the
  
  2012/13 school year (R. 66, 77; Ex. SD-1 at 2).
  
         Ms.         (formerly           ) testified at the hearing that the student’s primary
  
  educational need was support for                                                      (R. 80).
  
  To address those                        , the April 2013 CSE recommended the following
  
                          for the student:

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  
                        (R. 60-61; Ex. SD-1 at 3).      The CSE also included an annual
  
  educational goal in the student’s IEP to                                                 and
  
                                          (Ex. SD-1 at 7).
  
         D. Proposed Placement
  
         The parent asserts that the IEP could not have been appropriately implemented in
  
  the recommended placement, that
  
                                                                     , and that the
  
                    was not appropriate for him (Ex. P-A at 2).
  
         Generally, the sufficiency of the program offered by a school district must be
  
  determined on the basis of the IEP itself. See R.E., 694 F.3d at 186-88. The Second
  
  Circuit has explained that "[s]peculation that the school district will not adequately adhere
  
  to the IEP is not an appropriate basis for unilateral placement." R.E., 694 F.3d at 195; see

  v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 589 Fed. App'x 572, 576 (2d Cir. Oct. 29, 2014); T.Y .,
  
  584 F.3d at 419. The Second Circuit has explained that, when parents have rejected an
  
  offered program and unilaterally placed their child prior to implementation of the
  
  student's IEP, "[p]arents are entitled to rely on the IEP for a description of the services
  
  that will be provided to their child," see P.K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 526 Fed.
  
  App'x 135, 141 (2d Cir. May 21, 2013), and that "'[t]he appropriate inquiry is into the
  
  nature of the program actually offered in the written plan,' not a retrospective assessment
  
  of how that plan would have been executed," K.L. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 530
  
  Fed. App'x 81, 87 (2d Cir. July 24, 2013), quoting R.E., 694 F.3d at 187. Accordingly,
  
  when a parent brings a claim challenging the district's "choice of school, rather than the
  
  IEP itself, the appropriate forum for such a claim is 'a later proceeding' to show that the
  
  child was denied a free and appropriate public education 'because necessary services
  
  included in the IEP were not provided in practice.'" F.L. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ.,
  
  553 Fed. App'x 2, 9 (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2014), quoting R.E., 694 F.3d at 187 n.3. Therefore,
  
  if the student never attends the public schools under the proposed IEP, there can be no

  denial of a FAPE due to the parent's suspicions that the school district will be unable to
  
  implement the IEP. See R.E., 694 F.3d at 195; E.H., 2015 WL 2146092, at *3.
  
           However, the Second Circuit has held that a district's assignment of a student to a
  
  particular public school site is an administrative decision that must be made in
  
  conformance with the CSE's educational placement recommendation, and the district is
  
  not permitted to assign the student to a school that cannot implement the IEP. See M.O.
  
  v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 793 F.3d 236, 244-45 (2d Cir. 2015); R.E., 694 F.3d at
  
  191-92; T.Y ., 584 F.3d at 419-20; C.F.,746 F.3d at 79. In particular, the Second Circuit
  
  has stated that claims regarding an assigned school's ability to implement an IEP may not
  
  be speculative when they consist of "prospective challenges to [the assigned school's]
  
  capacity to provide the services mandated by the IEP." See M.O., 793 F.3d at 246; see
  
  also Y .F. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2015 WL 4622500, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 31,
  
  2015) (noting that the "the inability of the proposed school to provide a FAPE as defined
  
  by the IEP [must be] clear at the time the parents rejected the placement"); M.C. v.New
  
  Y ork City Dep't of Educ., 2015 WL 4464102, at *6-*7 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2015) (noting
  
  that claims are speculative when parents challenge the willingness, rather than the ability,
  
  of an assigned school to implement an IEP); S .E. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2015
  
  WL 4092386, at *12-*13 (S.D.N.Y. July 6, 2015) (noting the preference of the courts for
  
  "'hard evidence' that demonstrates the assigned [public school] placement was 'factually
  
  incapable' of implementing the IEP"); N.S. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 2014 WL
  
  2722967, at *12-*13 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2014).
  
           In view of the foregoing, the parent cannot prevail on her claims regarding the
  
  implementation of the April 2013 IEP and/or the assigned public school site.                    It is
  
  undisputed that the parent rejected the recommended public program and instead chose to
  
  enroll the student in a nonpublic school of her choosing prior to the time the DOE became
  
  obligated to implement the April 2013 IEP (Ex. P-H).5
  
           As to the parent’s argument that the student would not have been appropriately
  
  functionally grouped within the proposed                  classroom (Exs. P-A at 2, P-D), the
  
  
  5
   Indeed, the January 15, 2013               indicates that the student has never attended a public
  school program (Ex. SD-3).

   Case No. 155154
  
  
  
  basis of that concern was an observation of the proposed program in June 2013
  
  (R. 94; Ex. P-D). The parent did not obtain any information regarding the specific
  
  classroom into which the student may have been placed had he attended the assigned
  
  school, or the functional abilities of the students in any such class.     The evidence
  
  contained in the hearing record provides support only for what the parent believed might
  
  occur at the assigned school, rather than evidence that the assigned school was incapable
  
  of implementing the student's IEP. A number of courts have noted the speculative nature
  
  of grouping claims when a student never attends the assigned public school site, and the
  
  parent presents no argument for departing from this authority.      See M .C., 2015 WL
  
  4464102, at *7; R.B. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 15 F. Supp. 3d 421, 436 (S.D.N.Y.
  
  2014), aff'd, 603 Fed. App'x 36; B.K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 12 F. Supp. 3d
  
  343, 371 (E.D.N.Y. 2014); N.K. v. New Y ork City D ep't of Educ., 961 F. Supp. 2d 577,
  
  590 (S.D.N.Y. 2013); J.L., 2013 WL 625064, at *11 (noting that the "IDEA affords the
  
  parents no right to participate in the selection of . . . their child's classmates").
  
  Accordingly, the parent's claims based on her observations regarding other students at the
  
  assigned public school site generally, rather than with respect to the implementation of
  
  the student's IEP, cannot provide a basis for a finding of a denial of a FAPE in this
  
  instance. See R.B., 589 Fed. App'x at 576 (holding that a parent's observations during a
  
  visit to an assigned school constituted speculative challenges that the school would not
  
  implement the student's IEP).
  
         As the IEP was appropriate to meet the student's needs for the reasons set forth
  
  above, any conclusion that the DOE would have denied the student a FAPE by failing to
  
  implement the IEP at the assigned public school site based on functional grouping or
  
  ability to implement required services would necessarily be based on impermissible
  
  speculation, and the DOE was not obligated to present retrospective evidence at the
  
  impartial hearing regarding the implementation of the student's program at the assigned
  
  public school site or to refute the parent's claims related thereto. See M.O., 793 F.3d at
  
  245-46; R.B., 589 Fed. App'x at 576; F.L., 553 Fed. App'x at 9; K.L., 530 Fed. App'x at
  
  87; R.E., 694 F.3d at 187 & n.3.

    Case No. 155154
  
  
  
          In summary, the evidence in the hearing record establishes that the DOE
  
  offered the student a FAPE for the 2013/14 school year. Having made this determination,
  
  it is not necessary to consider the appropriateness of                  or to consider
  
  whether equitable factors favor an award of tuition reimbursement and/or direct payment
  
  to the private school. See M.C. v. V oluntown, 226 F.3d 60, 66 (2d Cir. 2000); C.F. v.
