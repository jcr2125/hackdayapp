  INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
  
          On September      28, 2016, the New York City Department of Education
  
  (hereinafter, “DOE” or “District”) appointed the undersigned to act as the impartial
  
  hearing officer (hereinafter, “IHO”) in a case brought under the Federal Individuals with
  
  Disabilities Education Act [20 USC § 1415(f)(3)] (“IDEA”) and the applicable provisions
  
  of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education [8 NYCRR 200.5] by the parent of
  
                     (hereinafter “the Student”). The Parent requested the hearing by filing a
  
  due process complaint that was filed with DOE on September 13, 2016.
  
          After preliminary and/or ancillary determinations this matter was scheduled for
  
  hearing on March 8, 2017 and March 20, 2017, wherein substantive testimony and
  
  evidence was received by this IHO and more particularly summarized elsewhere in this
  
  decision. The parties elected to provide written summations and memoranda that were
  
  received by this IHO and admitted into evidence as IHO Exhibits I and II. Where
  
  appropriate and after careful consideration of the cumulative impact of the criteria set-
  
  forth in the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education certain extensions were
  
  granted of the timeline. The record ultimately closed on May 1, 2017.

  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
          The purpose of the IDEA is “to ensure that all children with disabilities have
  
  available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education
  
  and related services designed to meet their unique needs.” (Bd. Of Educ. V . Rowley, 458
  
  U.S. 176, 179-91 (1982)) Implicit in the congressional purpose of providing access to a
  
  free and appropriate public education (hereinafter “FAPE”) is the requirement that the
  
  education to which access is provided be sufficient to confer some educational benefit
  
  upon the handicap child. (Id.)
  
          Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §1401(9) and 34 C.F.R. §300.17 FAPE is defined as
  
  follows:
  
          Special Education and related services that are provided at public expense under
  
          public supervision and direction and without charge; meet the standards of the
  
          SEA… include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school
  
          education in the State involved; and are provided in conformity with the
  
          individualized education program (IEP).
  
          In deciding whether the Respondent provided a student with a FAPE, the inquiry
  
  is typically: (1) whether the Respondent complied with the procedures set forth in IDEA;
  
  and (2) whether the student’s IEP is reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                          7
  
   Case No. 163221
  
  
  
  educational benefit (Rowley, supra.). Under the second prong, a school district need not
  
  maximize the potential of child but must open the door of public education in a
  
  meaningful way, and the IEP must provide the opportunity for more than only a “trivial
  
  advancement” (P. v. Newington Bd. Of Educ., 546 F.3d. 111 (2nd Cir. 2008)).
  
         The IEP is “the centerpiece of the statute’s education delivery system for disabled
  
  children” (Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988)). An appropriate educational program
  
  begins with an IEP that accurately reflects the results of evaluations to identify the
  
  student's needs, establishes annual goals related to those needs, and provides appropriate
  
  specialized instruction and related services (see 34 C.F.R. §300.320 (a)) For an IEP to be
  
  “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,” it must be
  
  “likely to produce progress, not regression” (W alczak v. Florida Union Free Sch. Dist.,
  
  142 F.3d 119, 130 (2d Cir. 1998)).
  
         Additionally, each public agency must ensure that, as soon as possible following
  
  the development of an IEP, special education and related services are made available to
  
  the child in accordance with the child’s IEP. In order to implement the IEP, a team that
  
  includes the child's parents determines where the child should be placed based on the
  
  child's IEP. Thus, the placement should not dictate the IEP but rather the IEP determines
  
  whether a placement is appropriate. (Rourke v. District of Columbia, 460 F.Supp.2d 32,
  
  44 (D.D.C. 2006)).
  
         The DOE must ensure that the IEP team reviews a student’s IEP periodically, but
  
  not less than annually, to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being
  
  achieved. Moreover, the DOE must ensure that the IEP team revises the IEP, as
  
  appropriate, to address any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals; and the
  
  results of any reevaluation or information about the child provided to, or by, the parents.
  
  Additionally, if the parent obtains an independent educational evaluation (“IEE”) at
  
  public expense, or shares with the public agency an evaluation obtained at private
  
  expense, the school district must consider the results of the evaluation, if it meets agency
  
  criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE to the child. The
  
  IDEA mandates that an IEP be based on the results of the most recent evaluation of a
  
  student.

   Case No. 163221
  
  
  
         In determining the appropriate placement for a child, preference is given to the
  
  least restrictive environment and the appropriate schools nearest the child's home (Id.).
  
  The IDEA requires that unless the IEP of a child with a disability requires some other
  
  arrangement, the child is too educated in the school that he or she would attend if the
  
  student was otherwise not disabled. In selecting the least restrictive environment,
  
  consideration is given to any potential harmful effect on the child or on the quality of the
  
  services that he or she needs. A child with a disability is not removed from education in
  
  age appropriate regular classrooms solely because of needed modifications in the general
  
  education curriculum (See 34 C.F.R. § 300.116).
  
         In cases where the relief sought is tuition reimbursement or reimbursement for
  
  other services a three-prong approach delineated in Burlington School Comm. V . Dept. of
  
  Education (471 U.S. 359 [1985]) and its progeny has developed. It is therefore necessary
  
  to determine if (1) the services offered by the school district were inadequate or
  
  inappropriate and therefore resulted in a denial of FAPE; (2) the services selected by the
  
  parents were appropriate; and (3) equitable considerations support the parent’s claim.
  
             Pursuant to New Y ork Education L aw §4401(c)(1) the DOE shall have the burden
  
  of proof, the burden of persuasion, and the burden of production in impartial hearings
  
  except for instances where the parent is seeking tuition reimbursement for a unilateral
  
  parental placement and in those cases the parent shall have the burden of persuasions and
  
  the burden of production as to the appropriateness of the placement. The burden of proof
  
  in matters such as this shall only be met upon a fair preponderance of the evidence. The
  
  preponderance of the evidence standard requires that the trier of fact to find that the
  
  existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence (Concrete Pipe & Products of
  
  C alif ornia, Inc. v. Construction L aborers Pension Trust for Southern California, 508 U.S.
  
  602, 622 (1993)).
  
         Unlike other standards of proof, the preponderance-of-evidence standard allows
  
  both parties to share the risk of error in a roughly equal fashion, except that when the
  
  evidence is evenly balanced, the party with the burden of persuasion must lose (Director,

   Case No. 163221
  
  
  
  DISCUSSION
  
  Provisioning of a Free and Appropriate Education
  
         Almost all requests for relief have a basic threshold question, whether or not the
  
  District provisioned a FAPE for this Student. Pursuant to New Y ork Education L aw
  
  §4401(c)(1) the District must bear the burden of proving that the Student was provisioned
  
  a free and appropriate education. As is in most cases, the Individualized Education
  
  Program (IEP) become the focal point for this determination. If the district presents
  
  sufficient witnesses and evidence to support the claim that the IEP was reasonably
  
  calculated to confer an educational benefit for this Student then the District has met its
  
  burden.
  
         “Reasonably calculated” as the phrase         suggests is not meant to be an
  
  insurmountable burden for the district. The IDEA envisions a collaboration of educators,
  
  diagnostic professionals and the parent’s working together as a team to develop a
  
  program and plan for students with unique and special needs. As with all groups,
  
  reasonable people can disagree as to the “best” or “most appropriate” course of action to
  
  any particular problem. These types of disagreements should be resolved in a
  
  collaborative effort and the leader of the CSE team should attempt to build consensus
  
  among the differing viewpoints. Ultimately, only one plan can be developed and it rests
  
  with the CSE to develop that plan.
  
         If an IEP is carefully and thoughtfully crafted it should be readily clear as to the
  
  reasoning behind the service plan and goals for the Student. In the instant case the central
  
  disagreement of the provisioning of FAPE is that the proposed placement as identified by
  
  the District could not implement the IEP as written. While the parties may continue to
  
  disagree as to the provisioning of services the IEP generated by the District becomes the
  
  minimum the parties should be expected to provide. In the instant case the testimony is
  
  clear that the District’s placement could not implement the IEP as written. The IEP
  
  requires that the Student be placed in a
  
       . The testimony states that the Student would have only received
  
                                        . Moreover the school while offering ESP could not
  
  offer the programming requirements as stated in the IEP.

    Case No. 163221
  
  
  
  Ms.            ’s testimony in the matter appeared to be vague and I therefore am unable
  
  to reconcile that “                ” is the same as the services directed in the IEP.
  
          While minor deviations from the IEP can and should be expected, substantive
  
  deviations in the program and services must be reconciled through the CSE. Any
  
  placement charged with the responsibility of implementing the IEP must make practical
  
  decisions on its implementation, however, they cannot simply make changes unilaterally.
  
          In the instant matter the parent requested a reconvene to address the perceived
  
  deficits of the proposed placement, it was at this time the parties could have reconvene to
  
  discuss the issues and perhaps make modifications should they have been necessary to
  
  ensure the student was provided a FAPE. However, the District declined to do so
  
  dismissing the parental concerns “out of hand”. This sua sponte decision failed to address
  
  the practical limitations of the placement and denied the parent an opportunity to further
  
  participate in the placement decision for the Student.
  
          Based on the foregoing I find that the District failed to provide the student with a
  
  FAPE for the 2016-2017 school year.
  
  The Appropriateness of the Unilateral Placement
  
          With respect to the relief of tuition reimbursement, the regulations and case law is
  
  quite clear, the parent’s shoulder the burden of proving that the unilateral placement for
  
  the Student is appropriate. While the case law that has developed is equally clear that this
  
  appropriateness of the unilateral placement is not as rigid as the Rowley standards for the
  
  District the unilateral placement must be sufficiently unique to address the unique needs
  
  of the Student. Taking this one step further, the unilateral placement must not be “one size
  
  fits all” approach but tailored to address the unique needs of the student and that this
  
  tailored instruction must show some benefit for the Student.
  
          In the instant matter, the parents have established by a fair preponderance of the
  
  evidence the progress that the Student has made while at                                during
  
  the 2016-2017 school year. The Parent’s have further proven that the program is a
  
                           is the fact that
  
  
  
                                                                                          (Ex. E,

  F; Tr. 115-6). The record also established the unique needs of the Student have been
  
  addressed in individualized and meaningful ways by the school and its personnel in order
  
  for the Student to make progress while at the placement. (Ex. F; Tr. 127-8).
  
         Based on the foregoing, I find that the parent’s unilateral placement is appropriate.
  
  Equity Determination
  
         With respect to the relief of tuition reimbursement an assessment must be made as
  
  to equitable determinations. This determination, in essence is a whether or not the
  
  parent’s acted in good faith with the district. Much like the District is required to not “pre-
  
  determine” a plan or placement before the IEP meeting, so too are the parents required
  
  not to “pre-determine” a particular placement of their child. This requirement embodies
  
  the idea that the CSE meeting is meant to be collaborative approach where all parties are
  
  participating meaningfully.
  
         In the instant matter, the District argues the conclusory premise that the Parent’s
  
  had no intention of enrolling the child in the placement. The basis of this conclusion from
  
  the District relies on the fact that the student was never enrolled in the public school
  
  placement and that the Parent’s have yet to remit meaningful payment to the private
  
  school placement and collection efforts of the school have not been implemented.
  
         While the issues of payment are supported by the record the conclusion that the
  
  Parent’s acted in bad faith and thus equities do not favor them is not. The Parent testified
  
  that had a public school placement been provided the Student would have been enrolled
  
  and no evidence provided by the District even suggests that this statement was
  
  disingenuous of the Parent.
  
         I therefore find that equities favor reimbursement.
  
  ORDER
  
  BASED ON THE FOREGOING, IT IS,
  
         ORDERED that the District failed to provision a FAPE to the Student for the 2016-
  
  2017 school year, and it is further;
  
         ORDERED that the Parent’s have met their burden in establishing                    the
  
  appropriateness of the unilateral placement, and it is further;
  
         ORDERED that the no equitable considerations exist the would reduce or
