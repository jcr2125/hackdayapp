   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  INTRODUCTION
  
           On the above dates, I conducted hearings, pursuant to the Individuals Disability
  
  Education Act (IDEA, 20 U.S.C. section 1415 (f)(3) regarding a special education
  
  program, Students with Disability, New York City Impartial Hearing Case # 156531.The
  
  hearings were conducted at the impartial hearing office, New York City Department of
  
  Education, at 131 Livingston Street, Brooklyn, New York.               At the hearing, the
  
  Department of Education, hereinafter referred to as the “DOE” was represented by its
  
  designee                       and the parent was represented by her counsel
  
  
  
  BACKGROUND
  
           The child, hereinafter referred to as      is a                ; as per the Parent he
  
  has
  
          . Additionally, since the end of the 2014-2015 school year, the DOE and the
  
  Committee of Special Education (CSE) denied                special education services. Parent
  
  alleges that in May 2015, the “CSE” declassified her son despite
  
                      . The CSE allegedly ignored the several attempts of his mother to
  
  discuss her son’s needs and instead requested an impartial hearing.
  
           Parent’s counsel maintained that during the 2015-2016 school year, the CSE
  
  continued to ignore                                           . The CSE was provided with a
  
                                                   in December 2015, a                       in
  
  March 2016, and a                                   in July 2016 confirming                  .
  
  No action was taken until the DOE held a meeting in August 2016 to discuss providing
  
        with special education services; however, they refused to provide same.
  
           Parent maintains that as the DOE failed to provide appropriate services to her son
  
  and that she enrolled him in a private special education school. She is seeking tuition
  
  reimbursement from the “DOE”, compensatory services for
  
  for the 2015-2016 school year and reimbursement for an
  
  from November 2015.
  
  
  
  THE DOE’S POSITION

    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
          On September 27, 2016 the DOE was served with a notice alleging that the DOE
  
  failed to provide        with a FAPE, wrongly declassified him and incorrectly found him
  
  ineligible for services. The DOE maintains that it followed the procedures of the
  
  Chancellor's regulations in accordance with the Educational Law and determined that
  
  is a student without an educational disability and ineligible for services.
  
                is a student who's
  
                                                           . Concededly, while
  
                       , his difficulties aren't affecting his progress academically and as such,
  
  is not a child with a disabilities.
  
  THE PARENT’S POSITION
  
          That she is entitled to reimbursement for
  
                                        as the DOE ignored her son’s                           and
  
  provided entirely inappropriate recommendations. Additionally,                  ’s
  
  continue due to the CSE’s mishandling of her son’s educational needs.
  
          Parent also requests that the DOE should be required to provide direct payment to
  
  the                 for her son’s tuition as it failed to provide      with an appropriate public
  
  school placement for the 2016-2017 school year. Lastly, the Parent is seeking a Related
  
  Service Authorization (RSA) for a from a
  
                                     to compensate for the DOE’s failure to provide him with
  
                                     for the entire 2015-2016 school year.
  
  THE DEPARTMENT’S CASE
  
          Ms.                   testified that she is currently employed by the DOE in
  
                as an impartial hearing representative and has been in her position since
  
  August of 2016.
  
  Prior to that she was working as a                               for       and is a        . She
  
  stated that her responsibilities as a                       at          , include
  
  
  
                            .
  
          The witness conducted an IEP meeting for a reevaluation for            ; she was directed
  
  to Exhibit 4-3, and stated that         was described by his teachers and by school personnel

      Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  as                                                      and that he's                      . The
  
  team reviewed a                        that was conducted by a DOE                             ,
  
  teacher reports and progress reports. The witness recalled that              was classified as
  
  “                                 ”. She reviewed a                                  , District
  
  Exhibit 2, and stated that the recommendations were as follows, "
  
  
  
  
                                                                            . Therefore,
  
            , were not recommended.
  
           She recalled that the parents voiced objections and concerns regarding the
  
  District's recommendation at the time of the meeting. Additionally, she was objecting to
  
  the presence of school personnel involved at the meeting; the chairperson, Ms.
  
         explained to her that since it was an IEP meeting, that program recommendations
  
  require that the school have members of the team present. The witness was directed to
  
  District Exhibit 4, the attendance page from meeting, and stated the following attendees
  
  were present:                          a                  , an                           , and a
  
                              or          at the meeting. All teachers and support staff agreed
  
  with the District's recommendation of declassification.
  
           Upon cross examination, the witness stated that the Parent was not present at the
  
  IEP meeting; that she participated on the phone. She recalled a discussion regarding
  
  rescheduling of the meeting and stated that “
  
                                                 . The Parent requested a rescheduling and
  
  stated that she didn’t want the                                  present. She remembered that
  
  scheduling was an issue, but didn’t recall specifics.
  
           Ms.        didn’t remember if there were CSE minutes taken at this meeting. She
  
  recalled that the team reviewed a                       from January 2015, however didn’t
  
  review an evaluation from                                        . The witness was directed to
  
  Exhibit A, she recalled that there was another evaluation conducted by an agency that the
  
  DOE contracted out for, however she didn't review that report as it was deemed not to be
      Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                          7
  
      Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  a good report, and that's why we had another                           ”. She was uncertain if
  
  Exhibit A was the report as she never reviewed same.
  
           The witness believed that the Parent may’ve brought to our attention that the
  
  report was poor and contained several grammatical errors. Consequently, “
  
  
  
                                                    . The witness stated that “
  
                                      . The witness was directed to Exhibit 6 and conceded
  
  that it was reviewed at the meeting and confirmed that the provider was working on
  
                    with the child; he wasn't working on                                       as
  
  the Parent “requested that she shouldn't”. Upon further questioning, the witness stated that
  
  she believed that it was “
  
                                                                       ”. She confirmed that the
  
  report stated that “
  
  
  
                     ."
  
           The witness was directed to Exhibit F, an IEP from April 23, 2014; the mandate
  
  on page 6 provided for
  
           . She was uncertain if this was the last IEP and in effect at the time of time of the
  
  meeting. She was unaware that the DOE had provided an RSA for                                 .
  
  As per Exhibit 2, the witness acknowledged that it indicated that             through an RSA at
  
                               was receiving                             . She conceded that the
  
  team reviewed this report in the meeting. Ms.                testified that as the parent never
  
  shared any documents to indicate that progress was not reviewed; she conceded that the
  
  DOE was paying for the                     and that it was mandated on his IEP.
  
           The witness was directed to DOE Exhibit 5 and it stated that there are times that
  
  “
  
                                      . During the IEP meeting, the witness stated that she
  
  didn’t recall if she reviewed the goals from the prior IEP.
  
  THE PARENT’S CASE
  
           During the 2014-2015 school year,        attended               at                   .

  (Tr. 148: 12-16.) He was classified with                                 and received
  
                                         pursuant to an IEP created in April 2014. (Parent’s Ex.
  
  F, Tr. 149: 4-9.) In December 2014, the CSE initiated a                              of     (Tr.
  
  149: 21-23.)                                              (“         ”), an independent agency
  
  with no relationship to        or the DOE, conducted the evaluation. (Parent’s Ex. A, Tr.
  
  150: 7-9.) The evaluation examined                                            and found
  
                                            which indicated that
  
         . (Parent’s Ex. A at 5.) The evaluation also found that
  
                                                            and recommended that he receive
  
                    . (Id.) After the evaluation was completed, the CSE deemed it
  
  unacceptable. According to the Parent, it was disqualified for                            . (Tr.
  
  151: 5-17.)
  
         A                             evaluator from the DOE conducted a second evaluation.
  
  (DOE Ex. 2, Tr. 153: 4-12.), which indicated
  
                          and determined that                                               . This
  
  confirmed a                                     (DOE Ex. 2 at 4.) The DOE ’s evaluator
  
  determined that                                                than the independent evaluation
  
  from           ; however, the DOE’s report did not recommend                                . (Id
  
  at 2.) The report directed      to                                         . (Id.)
  
         After the completion of this report, in May 2015, the CSE scheduled an IEP
  
  meeting to review       ’s special education services. The Parent stated that she requested
  
  that the CSE adjourn the meeting to a later date because she could not be physically
  
  present at the meeting as she was traveling. (Tr. 154: 7-18.) The CSE denied her request,
  
  held the meeting and the Parent stated that she had no choice other than to attend by
  
  phone. Additionally, that it was difficult to meaningfully participate by sharing her
  
  thoughts and asking questions to the other individuals involved. (Tr. 200: 18 – 201: 3, 18

             , and entirely ignored the independent December 2014 evaluation. (Tr. 40: 3-6,
  
  155: 16-21, 156: 8-11.) The DOE’s January 2015 evaluation did not recommend

         The Parent did not agree with the CSE’s decision to declassify her son; although
  
  she could’ve have requested an impartial hearing, she stated that she preferred to work
  
  with the CSE. Following the meeting, the Parent wrote to                           , the            of the
  
  CSE, asking for a second IEP meeting. (Parent’s Ex. G, Tr. 151: 19-20, 156: 18 – 157:
  
  8.); she did not receive a response.         She sent a second letter on May 22, 2015 again
  
  requesting a second IEP meeting and for an                                                 . (Parent’s Ex.

  2015 (Parent’s Ex. I, Tr. 160: 4-14.) On June 11, 2015, the DOE initiated the impartial
  
  hearing proceeding. (DOE Ex. A, Tr. 160: 21-23

           The Parent stated that she provided both evaluations to the CSE. In December
  
  2015, shortly after she received a copy of               ’s report she provided it to

  The CSE did not convene a meeting after receiving                   ’s evaluation. (Tr. 169: 11-

                                     and provided the team with another copy of                ’s
  
  report during the meeting. The team informed the Parent that they were not comfortable
  
  with considering the report as they claimed that they had just received it. (Tr. 175: 14-20.)
  
  After the meeting concluded, the Parent sent the IEP team another copy of                    ’s

  from the DOE in response to her letter. (Tr. 182: 20-25.)
  
  FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
  
         The purpose behind the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is to
  
  (20 U.S.C. section 1400-1482) ensure that students with disabilities have available to
  
  them a FAPE; see Schaffer v. Weast, 126 S. Ct. 528, 531 [2005]; Bd. Of Education v.
  
  Rowley 458 S.CT. 176, 179-81 [1982]; Frang G. v. Bd. Od Edu. 459 F. 3d 356 371 92d
  
  Cir. 2006). A FAPE includes special education and related services designed to meet the
  
  student’s unique need provided in conformity with a comprehensive written IEP            (20
  
  U.S.C. section 1401 [9] [D] 34 C.F.R. section 300.13 see 210 U.S.C. section 1414 ‘d’ ; 34
  
  CFR Section 200-347_. The student’s recommended program must also be provided in
  
  the east restrictive environment (LRE) (20 U.S.C. section 1412 [a][5]aA]; CFR section
  
  300.13 [a][2][i], 200. 1.116 [a][2]; 8 NYCRR 200.6 [a][1]; see Walczak v. Fla. Union
  
  Free School Dist. 142 F. 3d 119, 132 [2d cir. 1998]
  
         The legal standard applicable to request for payment for educational services such
  
  as in this case is well established. A Department of Education may be required to pay for
  
  educational services obtained for a child by the child’s parents if: 1. the services offered
  
  by the Department of Education were inadequate or inappropriate, 2, the services selected
  
  by the parents were appropriate and 3. equitable considerations support the parent’s
  
  claims (Sch. Comm. Of Burlington v. Dept. of Educ. 471 U.S. 359 [1985]; Florence
  
  County Sch. Dist. Foru v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 [1993]; Cerra v. Pawling Center. School
  
  Dist. 427 F. 3d 186, 192 [2d Cir. 2005] “reimbursement merely requires a district to
  
  belatedly pay expenses that it should have paid all along and would have borne in the first
  
  instance had it developed a proper IEP”.
  
         Under the second criteria of the legal standard, the child’s parent bears the burden

   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  of proof with regard to appropriateness of the services which the parents obtained for the
  
  child for the current school year (Application of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 94-
  
  29; Application of the Bd. Of Education of the Monroe-Woodbury CSE, Appeal No. 93-
  
  34; Application of a Child with a Disability, Appeal No. 95-57, in order to meet that
  
  burden, the parent must show that the services were “proper under the act”, (IDEA)
  
  (Burlington 471 U.S. at 370) i.e. that the private school offered an educational program
  
  which met the child’s special educational needs (Application of a Child with a Disability,
  
  Appeal NO. 94-29). The test for the parent’s private placement is that it is appropriate not
  
  that it is perfect (M.S. v Bd. Of Educ. 231 F. 3d 96, 105 [2d Cir. 2000] cert. denied 532
  
  U.S. 942 2001. The private school need not employ certified special education teachers,
  
  nor have its own IEP for the student. While parents are not held as strictly to the standard
  
  of placement in the LR as school districts are restrictiveness of the parental placement
  
  may be considered in determining whether the parents are entitled to an award of tuition

           The final criterion of ran award of tuition reimbursement is that the petitioners’
  
  claim is supported by equitable considerations (Carmel Centre Sch. Dist. V.V. P. 373 F.
  
  Supp. 2d 402, 416 [S.D.N.Y. 2005] aff’d 2006 WL 2334140 (2d cir. 2006);’ Frank G.
  
  459 F. 3d at 363-64). Equitable considerations are relevant to fashion relief under the
  
  IDEA (Burlington 471 U.S. at 374; Mrs. C. v. Voluntown Bd. Of Edu. 226 F. 3d 60, 68
  
  [2d Cir. 2000]; see Carter, 510 U.S. at 16 [noting that [c]ourts fashioning discretionary
  
  equitable relief under IDEA must consider all relevant factors, including the appropriate
  
  and reasonable level of reimbursement that should be required) such considerations
  
  include the parties, compliance or non compliance with state and federal regulations
  
  pending review the reasonableness of the parties’ positions and like matters (Wolfe v.

            The DOE designee stated that to be eligible for FAPE a child must have a
  
  disability that adversely affects their educational performance. The evidence established
  
  that the Parent's claims are meritless in accordance with the IDEA. Therefore,                         's
  
  parents are not entitled to perspective funding and/or tuition reimbursement for the
  
  unilateral placement at the                           for the 2016/2017 school year, nor are they
  
  eligible for compensatory                                              and/or reimbursement for their
  
  private                                          .
  
            Ms.               , the                                 who chaired the CSE review during
  
  the 2014/2015 school year, opined that                    is a student with specific challenges that do
  
  not warrant the exclusion of receiving instruction with typically-developing students. It is
  
  the DOE’s position that the testimony and evidence established that                    is a student who
  
                                                                                              ; due to his
  
                                    , he
  
                                .     In   light       of   these   facts,   and
  
                     , it led the IEP team to believe that he was no in need of special
  
  education services. He was ultimately declassified as an academically-disabled student.
  
            Furthermore as per testimony from                                , the                    who
  
  facilitated the IEP meeting in August 2016 to determine whether or not                          required
  
  special education support to address his                              , that he did not meet the criteria
  
  for special education support and/or services as outlined in the IDEA Section 300.8.. Ms.
  
                    stated that during this conference, the evidence highlighted that                  had
  
                                                                     , which led the IEP team once again
  
  to believe that he did not warrant special education services.
  
            The DOE asserts that they are not disputing                's struggles, however the question
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                        16
  
   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  is whether or not he requires special education services and/or related services to have
  
  equal access to the general education curriculum and make meaningful progress as
  
  outlined within the IDEA. Mr.              stated that the Parent answered these questions
  
  best when she stated      "
  
                 . Additionally, the testimony and evidence corroborates Ms. the Parent’s
  
  testimony.
  
         I will not repeat the all details of evidence where but the support and basis for my
  
  findings of fact and decision are grounded in that testimony as it appears above. I have
  
  considered the testimony of all of the witnesses who testified at the hearing. With respect
  
  to the issues presented at the hearing, I make the following findings of fact.
  
         1. I find that the parents have met their burden in proving that the services that
  
               they have unilaterally chosen for    are appropriate.
  
         2. Equitable considerations support the Parent and reimbursement and related
  
               relief is appropriate.
  
         As the State Review Officer has expressly recognized in the absence of evidence
  
  demonstrating that the parents failed to cooperate in the development of the IEP or
  
  otherwise engaged in conduct that precluded the development of an appropriate IEP,
  
  equitable considerations generally support a claim of tuition reimbursement.” See supra,
  
  Appeal No. 05-087 (referencing Application of the Board of Edu. Appeal No. 05-030;
  
  Application of the Board of Educ. Appeal No. 04-091; Application of a Child with a
  
  Disability, Appeal No. 04-049).
  
         When a parent believes a school district failed to provide their child with a FAPE,
  
  the parent may enroll the student in a private school at their own expense and request
  
  reimbursement. An IHO will award reimbursement if he or she finds that: (1) the
  
  educational program offered to the student by the school district was inappropriate; (2)
  
  the program selected by the parent was appropriate; and (3) the equitable considerations
  
  favor reimbursement. Forest Grove School Dist. v. T.A ., 557 U.S. 230, 246-47 (2009);

   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
           In New York, the Legislature has seen fit to place the initial burden on the school
  
  system to prove the appropriateness of both its educational program and placement for a
  
  student. Educ. Law § 4404(1)(c). Thereafter, the burden shifts to the parent to prove the
  
  appropriateness of his/her chosen school for the student and that the equities favor the
  
  parent. M .O. v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ., 793 F.3d 236, 243 (2nd Cir. 2015).       To
  
  meet its initial burden, the DOE must show that “a preponderance of the evidence”
  
  presented during the hearing establishes that the program offered to the student was
  
  appropriate. A .M. v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ., No. 15-4076, 2017 WL 83384, at *14
  
  (2d Cir Jan. 10, 2017). If the DOE is unable to present sufficient evidence to establish the
  
  appropriateness of its proposed program, it cannot meet its burden. Id. (reversing an IHO
  
  ruling because the DOE presented no evidence supporting the appropriateness of its IEP).
  
           As stated above, I find that the DOE failed the provide       with an appropriate
  
  educational program or placement for the 2016-2017 School Year. I agree with Parent’s
  
  counsel that the DOE failed to create a program or provide a placement for          for this
  
  current school year. The DOE maintained that an IEP was not provided to           in August
  
  2016 because his                                        was sufficiently high to not warrant
  
  services. (Tr. 85: 11-16.); the DOE failed to prove same and or provide evidence to
  
  establish the level of        ’s                       during the 2015-2016 school year.
  
  Additionally, I agree that the DOE produced no evidence of his ability to
  
                            .    The only evidence regarding     ’s abilities during the 2015-
  
  2016 school year were provide by the Parent and established that her son had difficulties
  
  with                                                                     . (Parent’s Exs. C,
  
  D, E.)
  
           I concur with Parent’s counsel in that                                            ,
  
  however this fact does not excuse the DOE from its obligation to provide special
  
  education services.      The U.S. Department of Education recognized in Letter to
  
  A nonymous, that students who have high cognition and have disabilities are protected
  
  under the IDEA and implementing regulations. Letter to A nonymous, 55 IDELR 172
  
  (2010) (stating that a student with ADHD could require special education services to
  
  address a lack of organizational skills.)

    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
          The Parent provided the DOE with two evaluations to establish that her son was
  
  struggling during the 2015-2016 school year. (Parent’s Ex. J, K, Tr. 233: 18-23, 273: 7.)
  
  However, when the Parent met with the DOE in August 2016, the team did not fully
  
  review these reports.   The Parent stated that the individuals at the CSE meeting only
  
  discussed the scores detailed in the                                 and didn’t discuss the
  
  diagnoses or recommendations of the report. (Tr. 174: 3-11.        At the IEP meeting, Ms.
  
          , testified to reviewing the report “thoroughly”; however, she didn’t remember
  
                                          or if                 and could not recall the report
  
  detailing his difficulty with                                                . (Tr. 82: 21, 83:
  
  19-20, 104: 18-22, 85: 13-14, 106: 2-5). As per Parent’s counsel, these deficits were
  
  reported upon in the                      section of the                                 which
  
  also explained how

          Additionally, the IEP team failed to appropriately review                   ’s
  
                                                  which was provided to the CSE in December
  
  2016; both during and after the IEP meeting, the team ignored its results. (Parent’s Ex K,

                                                                      ; this was the same level
  
  that     was at when he was evaluated in January 2015 (Parent’s Ex. D.) Furthermore,

  maintained that                                                          ; this information was
  
  not considered by the CSE.
  
          The CSE failed to conduct a follow up IEP to discuss that report despite its
  
  promise to do so.

  (Tr. 382: 4-9, 16-22.)
  
            Dr.                is familiar with the                  having worked with many
  
  students who attend it, and testified that it can provide an appropriate educational setting
  
  for        (Tr. 326: 5-8, 327: 9-10.). He explained that the school can meet his needs and
  
  provide
  
                                                           . Tr. 327: 9-16.)
  
            I agree that the                  is an appropriate placement for         and that he is
  
  making progress. Ms.               testified that she has observed him
  
                        , especially with regard to
  
                                          . (Tr. 386: 7-13.) She explained that
  
               and                                                           . (Tr. 374: 11-13, 386:
  
  19-23.) Although                                                         , the efforts he is making
  
  in this area are helping. (Tr. 387: 4-7.)
  
            Regarding equitable considerations, I find that the Parent cooperated with the
  
  DOE to identify the appropriate special education services for her son. On the very day
  
  that her son was declassified from special education, May 8, 2015, the Parent contacted
  
  the CSE to request another meeting. (Parent’s Ex. G, DOE’s Ex. 4.) After this May 8th
  
  communication, she contacted the CSE two more times to request a second opportunity to
  
  discuss her son’s special education needs as she was concerned about the DOE’s decision
  
  to declassify him. The Parent believed that she didn ’t have the opportunity to
  
  meaningfully participate in the May 8th IEP meeting. (Parent’s Ex H, I, Tr. 201: 18 – 202:
   Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                              22
  
   Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  4.) Instead of scheduling a second meeting to discuss her concerns, the DOE filed an
  
  impartial hearing request. (DOE Ex. 1.)
  
         I find that the Parent again made efforts to cooperate with the DOE in to the 2015-
  
  2016 school year. She received                ’s
  
             and provided it to Mr.            . She also provided Mr.             with her son’s
  
                                    in July 2016. (Parent’s Ex. J.) I find that she reasonably
  
  assumed that Mr.          would share reports with his colleagues at the CSE. The DOE
  
  never contacted the Parent to meet to discuss               ’s report. (Tr. 168: 7-8.) An IEP
  
  meeting   was   not   scheduled    until   August   2016   after     Mr.          received   the
  
                                . (Tr. 170: 11-17; 228: 6-7.)
  
         Incredibly, when the CSE held the IEP meeting in August 2016, the DOE
  
  representatives claimed they did not have                   ’s report. (Tr. 175:1.) After the
  
  Parent again provided the DOE with a copy of                       ’s report during and after the
  
  IEP meeting, the CSE representatives never contact her to discuss the report. (Tr. 179: 23-
  
  25.) I agree that the DOE’s lack of communication with the Parent in scheduling an IEP
  
  meeting and in timely reviewing the evaluations, demonstrate the DOE’s failure to
  
  equitably work with the Parent.
  
         Additionally, the Parent made additional efforts to cooperate with the DOE and
  
  secure special education services for her son were documented in the letter she submitted
  
  to the CSE, through her attorney, informing them of her intent to place her son at the
  
               for the 2016-2017 school year. (Parent’s Ex. L.) As required, she sent this
  
  letter more than ten business days before her son began at the                     on September
  
  8, 2016. (Id.) 20 USC § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(bb).
  
         The Parent expressed an interest in working with the DOE to appropriately
  
  classify her son and identify a special education placement for him in a public school.
  
  (Id.); however, she received no response from this letter and never received any program
  
  or placement for son. (Tr. 182: 20-25.)
  
         It is uncontroverted that the Parent signed an enrollment contract with the
  
         before she met with the DOE in August 2016. However, she stated that it was to
  
  ensure that she had a back-up plan for her son in case the DOE did not appropriately plan
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                         23
  
    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  for hi. She was aware that pursuant to her enrollment agreement she would be able
  
  withdraw her son from the                      any time before October 1st with limited
  
  financial consequences if the DOE provided her son with an appropriate educational
  
  placement. (Parent’s Ex. P at 3-4,Tr. 386: 20-25.) Finally, the Parent stated that she was
  
  aware of her obligation to pay the                 ’s tuition. (Tr. 184: 21-23.) While she is
  
  asking for an award of prospective funding paid directly to the                   due to her
  
  limited financial means, she understands she is bound by the                   ’s enrollment
  
  contract to pay for her son’s tuition. (Tr. 184: 24 – 185: 13.)
  
          New York courts have recognized that parents who cannot afford up-front
  
  payments should not be prevented from petitioning for publicly-funded tuition on the
  
  identical principles facing parents who have paid all, or part, of the tuition prior to
  
  seeking tuition reimbursement from a school district. S abatini v. Corning-Painted Post
  
  A rea Sch. Dist., 78 F.Supp.2d 138, 147 (W.D.N.Y. 1999) (granting preliminary injunction
  
  requiring a school district to pay for private placement and instructing the district to
  
  "make whatever financial arrangements are necessary" to allow student to attend private
  
  school); Connors v. Mills, 34 F. Supp. 2d 795, 804 (N.D.N.Y. 1998) ("It simply cannot be
  
  the case that an act designed to grant 'all' disabled children access to needed services
  
  would undermine that very goal by making such access dependent upon a family's
  
  financial situation.").
  
          I conclude that that the Parent cooperated in working with the DOE in an effort to
  
  identify an appropriate public school placement for her son and that the equities favor her
  
  position.
  
          Regarding compensatory services, as the DOE acted inappropriately when it
  
  decided to declassify      from receiving special education services and that he is entitled
  
  to receive same. The DOE failed to establish a credible reason to discredit the
  
              performed by           . The DOE’s impartial hearing request stated that it was
  
  disapproved due to grammatical, spelling and contextual errors. (DOE Ex. 1.) I agree with
  
  the Parent that the DOE produced no evidence of these errors or how they affected the
  
  substantive conclusions of the report. Ms.             testified that she was aware of the
  
  evaluation, however, never personally reviewed the report and could not explain why it
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                             24
  
    Case No. 156531
  
  
  
  was deemed inappropriate. The DOE presented no evidence to explain why the report was
  
  discredited. Additionally, the               report, prepared by an independent agent of the
  
  DOE also determined that               needed                                     because of his
  
                                        . When this evaluation assessed
  
  with the                         , he scored in the                  , however the report was
  
  conducted by a DOE professional which was the only report considered. Despite the fact
  
  that                                         , the DOE’s in-house report determined that
  
  was not in need of                                      ; the report recognized that child had
  
                        , but only recommended that
  
         . I find that                  ’s testimony was credible wherein he stated that this
  
  recommendation is “absolutely no[t] accurate” because
  
                                  and
  
         . (Tr. 258: 19 – 259.)
  
            The team that conducted         ’s May 2015 IEP meeting where he was declassified
  
  from special education, exhibited bad faith when it determined that the
  
                    produced by its own colleague should be afforded more weight than the
  
  report of an independent evaluator. Additionally, the team disregarded a recommendation
  
  within a                              from                    , the school       was attending at
  
  the time of the meeting that was also reviewed during the meeting. (DOE Ex. 6, Tr. 44:
  
  15-19.) Although the provider who wrote this report acknowledged that she was not
  
  addressing                              , she stated that he continued to show a need in
  
  goals. (DOE Ex. 6.) The only recommendation for a decrease in services that this report
  
  made, was that         no longer needed                             to address
  
  goals. I agree with Parent’s counsel that it is uncertain if the IEP team reviewed any of the
  
  goals on      ’s previous IEP, goals that addressed                          , to ensure they had
  
  been met before deciding to declassify him. Ms.                could not identify his previous
  
  IEP. (Tr. 50: 4-6.)
  
            I agree that at the time of the IEP meeting in May 2015, the DOE had more than
  
  sufficient evidence to find that          continued to need                                    to
  
  address                          . The DOE disregarded this evidence and denied              any
    Hearing Officer’s Findings of Fact and Decision                                           25

  special education services.
  
            The IDEA provides that courts "shall grant the relief that the court determines to
  
  be appropriate." (20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)( c) (iii); 34 C.F.R. § 300.516(c)(3).)
  
  Compensatory education is "prospective equitable relief” that requires a school district to
  
  fund education "as a remedy for any earlier deprivations in the child's education." Somoza
  
  v. New Y ork City Dept. of Educ., 538 F.3d 106, 109 n.2 (2d Cir. 2008).                ’s April
  
  2014 IEP mandated that he receive
  
            . (Parent’s Ex. F.) As such, to compensate             for the DOE’s inappropriate
  
  decision to withhold these sessions during the 2015-2016 school year when it declassified
  
  him, the DOE should be ordered to provide him with                                          for
  
  the entire school year, i.e.,                , of make-up service.
  
            The Parent is entitled to reimbursement for              ’s
  
                                     . 8 NYCRR § 200.5(g). (Parent’s Ex. D, Q.) The DOE’s
  
                                      from January 2015, which was the only such report the
  
  CSE ever considered, was wholly inappropriate and stands as an aberration among his
  
                       . The DOE’s report ignored the gravity of                             and
  
  provided entirely inappropriate recommendations with regards to addressing such issues.
  
  (Tr. 258: 19 – 259.) The DOE’s reports and recommendations directly contradicted the
  
  recommendation of the              ’s report, which was commissioned by the DOE and took
  
  place just one month earlier. (Parent’s Ex. A.) Additionally, as per Parent’s counsel, the
  
  inappropriateness of the DOE’s evaluation is further evidenced by the fact that a second
  
  independent evaluator,                       , identified   ’s need for
  
             ten months after the DOE’s evaluation. Furthermore,                            have
  
  continued through to the present day, evidencing that the DOE’s January 2015 report was
  
  inappropriate. I again agree with Parent’s counsel in that if the CSE had not disregarded
  
  the           ’s report, and/or if the DOE had conducted a proper evaluation in January
  
  2015, the Parent would not have needed to commission                      ’s report. Therefore,
  
  the Parent should be reimbursed by the DOE for the cost of                   ’s evaluation and
  
  report.
  
            I agree with the parents that   ’s require a                                  school

  setting with
  
            , and all services which can address her needs. I find that the
  
  where he has been in attendance since September 2016 is an appropriate placement for
  
     and that he has made “meaningful educational progress as evidenced by the testimony
  
  herein and by the academic interim report card.

         For the foregoing reasons, I Order the following:
  
             (1) That the DOE provide direct payment to the                       tuition for the
  
                 2016-2017 school year in an amount not to exceed the sum of
  
                 within 30 days of receipt of final bill.
  
             (2) That the DOE issue a RSA for a
  
                                                                   to compensate for the DOE’s
  
                 failure to provide       with                                     for the entire
  
                 2015-2016 school year.
  
             (3) That the DOE reimburse the Parent in the sum of               for the cost of the
  
                                                                       performed by
